<li>Self Introduction
</li><P>
I am from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I have completed my 11th and 12th classes in Sri Chaitanya Junior College as a day scholar. Those are the days which helped me to come here. I have studied and also enjoyed my 6th to 10th in Narayana e-techno school. These 5 years helped me gain my confidence, strength and also introduced me to my today‘s best friends. Those 5 years are the most memorable days of my life. My childhood i.e., LKG to 5th was in an amazing school named School of Wonder Kids. I have enjoyed myself a lot at this school because it was different from all others. It taught till 2nd class without any books and till 5th without any homework. But I laid my strong foundation there which helped and is helping me till today. About my family: I have a very beautiful and supportive family. My father is an employee who supports me all the time, but also very caring and loves me so much. My mother is the biggest strength of my life. She is my best friend and my best teacher. Without her I am nothing. Finally my brother is like an advisor to me. He might be younger to me but he is an advisor to me. My weakness is to think about anything a lot but sometimes it helps me to get the solution. So at last this is me and my introduction.</P>

Interests:
<P>
I like playing caroms and badminton and evening learning dance. I enjoy reading books, writing and doing anything that increases my happiness. I decided to become Engineer for the sake of my family and mainly to fulfil my mom‘s dream. A degree in Engineering enables me to achieve my goals and also gives me an opportunity to become an IAS civil service officer and to make a difference in the society and community as well.

ABOUT MYSELF
</li><P>
My name is HARI. I am a native of Kerala, the god‘s own country. I am currently doing my 3rd   year in engineering. I am now confused with where to start describing me. The first thing that came to my mind is my speed. My friends and family members use to complain about my speed as they do not understand what I am saying. But even though it affects my conversational skill, I can control it to an extent. On the other hand I find it as my greatest advantage as it enables me to do work faster.</P>
<P>
Sometimes I feel like my emotional skills are very weak. One of my passions is to repair things out but most of the time I am not sure that I am doing it in the correct way. Even though I tried to learn keyboard during my school days, I was not able to excel in that. Regarding the sports activities, during my childhood I like chess a lot which then turn to cricket and now it‘s in badminton.
<P>
Regarding my interests in politics and religion, I can‘t accept those who works to uplift and implement only their concepts and consider others as fools or uncivilized whether its in the case of political parties or religious leaders or even the atheists. My concept is like if one man‘s concept and idea about his life didn‘t cause any harm or any changes to others, then it is a good one. All the above mentioned groups of people believe that what they think is correct and others are wrong.</P>
<li>
