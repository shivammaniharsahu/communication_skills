        <h2 style="text-align: center;">INFORMATION TRANSFER AND INFORMATION TRANSFER CYCLE</h2>
        <div class="jumbotron">
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>2.1	Objectives:</li>
			<ul>
			<li>1.	To improve receptive and productive skills to produce organized thoughts.</li>
			<li>2.	To increase the stock of words and structures of the language.</li>
			<li>3.	To generate new ideas and widen the rage of mind.</li>
			<li>4.	To familiarize with various topics and to increase expressing ability.</li>
			 </ul>
			<p>Writing is one of the forms of language skills which play an important role in human communication. It is used to communicate and express ideas with people around and also to express our opinion in the form of writing. Writing necessitates writing precisely and at the same time precisely. One must have good proficiency in English which does not mean only to be effortless speakers of the language. There are some factors that influence the ones’ ability to write; </p>
			<ul>
			<li>1.	Vocabulary</li>
			<li>2.	Personal interest in the topics given</li>
			<li>3.	Interest of students in writing such as graphic, picture, maps </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Among all these factors, technique is a very important factor that should be given attention because by a good method, the students can get better their capability to put in order their ideas for good writing. Information transfer is the process of transfer of messages containing user information, it is kind of information which transferred across the timely and functional interface connecting a source with user. User information includes all the information from a source to a user..</p>
			<li>2.2	Bidirectional information transfer</li>
			<p>Information exchange is a bidirectional information transfer. According to Palmer in his book Information Transfer for Reading and Listening (1994:15), says “Information Transfer is an action that reproduces either from a full linguistic form into diagrammatic or semi diagrammatic form, or vice versa during the transfer activity, the information remains the same, but the form of information changes for instance, from nonlinguistic form to linguistic form.”</p>
			<li>2.3	Need for Information Transfer </li>
			<p>Information transfer is an activity which is the method to organize thoughts; it is suitable for teaching as well as learning language, because it helps the learners to develop their language skill. For example, when the learner is provided with information and knowledge, they can be motivated to organize their ideas or thoughts. Some learners may find it difficult to find new ideas or some may feel hesitant in expressing their ideas. During learning process of writing, the learners will be acquainted with sequence of activities, which may help them to acquaint knowledge about scenario. During the transfer of the contents of information, the learners must concentrate much on arranging and systematizing it in order to produce a superior writing. </p>
			 <p>This Information Transfer Technique is used in not only in Writing Information but also where transfer can be applied in either written form or spoken form. Palmer suggests that information transfer training can be used with productive and receptive techniques. The learners must read all the information carefully and then they transfer it from what they read. In addition, information transfer exercise which can be used effectively, applying productive skill in teaching, learning and writing by using information transfer. It requires participants to develop thoughts or ideas and it can strengthen their vocabulary, grammatical structure and idiom and so that the participants can get better in their capability to systematize and formulate their ideas into an effective writing. </p>
			<p>There are certain advantages of Using Information Transfer Technique, which gives some sort of advantages of information transfer technique such as</p>
			<p>1.	It can give diversity of technique which includes skills like</p>
			<p>a.	Listening</p>
			<p>b.	Speaking </p>
			<p>c.	Reading </p>
			<p>d.	Writing  </p>
			<p>2.	It covers very wide range of texts. </p>
			<p>3.	It can be organized or arranged easily so that learner can develop ability to systematize information. 
			It is evident that writing by using technique like information transfer can be more interesting and easier which can be easily taught to students. And it can also help to encourage and motivate the participants in learning writing in English. Writing helps to recognize our thoughts and ideas and also help us to soak up the information and makes us ready to transfer it to others. At very initial level of sentence formation, it includes control over content format, vocabulary, sentence structure, punctuation, sentence structure and spelling letter formation. Beyond the sentence the writer must be able to construct band integrating information into consistent and rational paragraphs and texts.</p>
			<li>2.4	Formal and Informal dialogues</li>

			<h2>INFORMATION TRANSFER CYCLE</h2>

			<li>2.5	Definition</li>
			<p>The information content whether formal or informal in any information system can be conveyed from one person to another person via communication or information transfer, this can be from equipment to person example computer or from person to equipment. It can be from product to person like inspection or person to person in form of conversation. The overall information organization must be such that it accomplishes the needs of both the sides.</p>

			<p>1.	Information Need</p>

			<p>Information is always needed it is a process of becoming attentive and conscious about details and relevance of Information.</p>

			<p>2.	Knowledge Creation</p>
			<p>Knowledge is externally produced but it is empirically grounded with the help of research and development. It can also be internally produced through development and research.</p>
			<p>3.	Knowledge Dissemination</p>
			<p>It is often experienced that one-way dispersion of information leads recipient to acquire help from other irrelevant alternative sources to learn more about it and gather more information. Sometimes dissemination is also used as an instrument for interactive communication as it provides an environment for multidirectional flow of information into systems or organization.</p> 

			<p>4.	Knowledge Organization</p>
			<p>Knowledge organization is an organized and well arranged structure of arrangement of all knowledge and information to makes it easy for further access, identification and retrieval for different purpose in organization.</p>

			<p>5.	Knowledge Utilization</p>
			<p>This aim of this process is to gain knowledge about how to use the knowledge acquired in best possible way.  Knowledge utilization can be further used to explain, solve problems, for further advancements and improve the structure, maintenance, development and quality of decision-making.</p>

			<p>6.	Knowledge Preservation</p>
			<p>It aims in storage and maintenance of knowledge and information for further use in future.</p>
			<li>2.6	Objectives</li>
			<p>Information transfer is a kind of communicative action in which the participants are actively involved in interpreting information in either linguistic form or visual form or symbolic form which is easily understood by the participant who are seeking for information in the activity without losing its essence. </p>
			<p>For example, teacher reads a story loudly in the class, all the students are listening to story attentively, later teacher provides student with exercise sheets in which same story content are given in the form of summary with some points are deleted.</p> <p>The learners are then required to fill the partly blanks points in connect the story line properly, which will give same essence to the story. In this activity learners are always asked to transfer information from listening to writing. And this technique can further be used to train the learner’s overall integrated skills. </p>
			<li>2.7	Advantages of Information transfer </li>
			<p>The information transfer method, when properly used, has many advantages over the conventional teaching technique. As far as the association between the teacher and learner is concerned, the student (learner) becomes an active language user and participant. The learner’s enthusiasm is also boosted to comprehend, understand and to communicate the essence in different forms. It also facilitate a language teacher in effective classroom management, </p>
			<p>There are many advantages of Information transfer over the traditional teaching techniques because it is based on principles of language learning, interpretation and acquisition of knowledge. The information transfer technique encourages the learner to get directly involved in informational communicative activities. All information transfer activities take place when there is information gap in participants and only to overcome this gap learner indulges themselves in the process of learning. </p>
