<p>Topic for a G D is given just before a few minutes or sometimes in advance. The topic may be an current affairs, social, political, economic environment, education, IT, management, sports. Every individual should know the topic. If the topic is known he/she has to write down the important points first then he/she has to analyze each point in order to explain clearly during the session of G.D. The individuals have to note down the main points, related to the main points with suitable examples. Thus the individual participant should have analytical and critical thinking to express views relevant to the topic with appropriate examples.

If the topic is new or unknown the individual has to remain silent and listen to other participants carefully when his turn comes he can state the same point relevant to the topic in his/ her own style.
the amount of time you speak for is not important but the quality of what you have said is important and the impact that it has on the group. You cannot dominate the GD by speaking for a long period of time. You have to influence a group by providing it direction, highlighting the important issues and
 
putting forth persuasive arguments. With respect to the right duration of participation in a G.D. there is no formula. In a 15-20 mts. G.D in which 6-10 participants, if you are able to speak for two minutes spread across three four occasions.

<p>o	Try to provide summary to the discussion. </p><h4>Group interaction strategies:</h4>
<p>One of the selection procedures or part of selection processes is group discussion. It is mainly to check team playing skills. You should understand the other person‘s point of view, while making your point and ensure that the team reaches a solution that is feasible and accepted by all the membersof the team.
