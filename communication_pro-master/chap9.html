the amount of time you speak for is not important but the quality of what you have said is important and the impact that it has on the group. You cannot dominate the GD by speaking for a long period of time. You have to influence a group by providing it direction, highlighting the important issues and
 
putting forth persuasive arguments. With respect to the right duration of participation in a G.D. there is no formula. In a 15-20 mts.

<p>One of the selection procedures or part of selection processes is group discussion. It is mainly to check team playing skills. You should understand the other personâ€˜s point of view, while making your point and ensure that the team reaches a solution that is feasible and accepted by all the membersof the team. Subject knowledge , oral communication skills , leadership skills and team management are the four major areas to evaluate in the selection of G.D.
