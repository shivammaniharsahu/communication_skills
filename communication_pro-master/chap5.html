<h3>5.2	Introduction:</h3>                                              
<p>While speaking our lungs are actively pushing air outward while the force of the pushing varies rhythmically in a way which correlates our speech. We speak in the successive units of our Breath pulse. The successive units of sounds are called syllables. In speaking, we breadth out but rarely breath in. The units of sounds produced during breath –out are called syllable.  Different speakers divided syllables differently. There are two main theories. They are the prominence theory and the pulse theory. In any utterance, the listeners find some more sonorous sounds and some less sonorous sounds. In syllabic analysis the more sonorous sounds are called peaks and less sonorous sounds are called valleys. The prominence theory is based on the listener’s perspective. Speaking is muscular activity. So the syllabification of a word is based on the way it is uttered not the way it is heard. The syllable division based on the word, it is heard is called the pulse theory. <p>The knowledge of syllabification in English speech enables the foreign speakers to cultivate the correct variations of the rhythmic patterns of words according to the context of communication.  This is the first step in understanding of communication. </p>
<p>The syllable is a complete sound unit. It is made up of one or more than one speech sound. Speech sounds are either vowels or consonant sounds. To the structure of a syllable the vowel is essential. The vowel is the obligatory element in a syllable and it is the nucleus. When a syllable begins with a consonant is called releasing consonant and when a syllable ends with a consonant is called the arresting consonant. In the syllable /fat/ f is the releasing consonant and t is the arresting consonant. In this ‘a’ (vowel) is the nucleus. A word may consist of any number of sound units. When a word has one sound unit it is called monosyllabic word. When a word has two syllables, it is called disyllabic words, when a word has three syllables it is called tri -syllabic words and a word has more than three syllables it is called poly syllabic words. Below a few examples are given with division of syllables.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Accent</h3>
<h3>5.3	Introduction</h3>
<p>Word stress or accent is an important feature of English. In a monosyllabic word there is no accent, but when there are two are more syllables in a word all syllables are not prominent, the prominent syllable receives accent and others do not. The prominence gets because of greater force and the length and the quality of the sound. When there are two prominent syllables in a word the more prominent of the two receives the primary accent and the other one receives the secondary accent,. The primary accent is marked above the syllable and the secondary accent is marked below the syllable. </p>
<p>Different varieties of a language are called accents, when they differ in pronunciation. As English is spoken vary widely, it has acquired a large number of accents. It has both native tongues and non- native tongues. The standard ones are the native educated accents called British R P (Received Pronunciation). The different native accents are English are chiefly in their vowel systems and the different non-native accents in a number of phonological and distributional features. R P is the most widely understood accent. Even in India R P is recommended as a model. As accentual pattern maintain during the articulation of words they are intelligible to all and the confusion of meaning and between words can be avoided.  Stress pattern is not only used during the articulation of words but also in connected speech. This accentual pattern gives beauty to the language during the utterance of words and sentences. English language has an important place among all languages. It has no rivals but few equals. </p>

<h3>5.4	Introduction</h3>
<p>Rhythm is a kind of periodicity. It means the recurrence of certain patterns of colour, design, or sound at regular intervals of space or time.  In music, a certain kind of beat or sound is repeated at equal interval s of time constitutes its rhythm. In language rhythm refers to the periodic recurrence of certain patterns of sound in utterances form a text. Rhythm brings beauty to the language. It makes distinction between poetry and prose. Accented syllables or unaccented syllable constitute utterances. Utterance of words is called connected speech. In a connected speech there may be any number of syllables.  On the whole regularity of accent is rhythm. The accentual pattern is the same in connected speech as in poly syllabic words said in isolation. In a connected speech all stressed syllables receive accent but the last syllable receives the primary accent and the others receive secondary accent.   </p>
<p>In connected speech, there may be any number of unaccented syllables between accented syllables. The accented syllables are uttered slowly and clearly and the unaccented syllables are uttered rapidly.   Accented syllables have a tendency to occur at approximately equal intervals of time, irrespective of the number of unaccented syllables intervening between one accented syllable and the next.  This is called time-stressed rhythm.  In connected speech we use both content words and form words. Content words have a specific meaning and form words or grammatical words no specific meaning.   Content words are important to the listener to get the meaning of the speaker, they are nouns, main verbs, adjectives, adverbs,   demonstrative and interrogative pronouns and the words yes and no. Usually the form words Such as personal pronouns, articles, prepositions, conjunctions and auxiliary words do not receive accent as they perform grammatical function.</p>
<h5>Some of the examples are given below:</h5>
<p>1.	She‘s more ‘beautiful than her ‘sister.</p>
<p>2.	He‘s the most ‘honest ‘man I’ve ever ‘met.</p>
<p>3.	‘Most of us ‘speak ‘English ‘well.</p>
<p>4.	We ‘need ‘more ‘milk for our ‘children.</p>
<p>5.	‘Give me some ‘water to ‘drink.</p>
<p>6.	Re’serve me a ‘seat.</p>
<p>7.	’Let me ‘keep some for the ‘girls.</p>
<p>8.	’Some people ‘prefer tea to ‘coffee.</p>
<p>9.	There’s ‘nothing in the ‘room.</p>
<p>10.	. She ‘put it ‘there.</p>
<p>11.	‘Some of ‘those ‘boys are ‘here.</p>
<p>12.	Let’s ‘help each ‘other.</p>

 <h5>Exercise:</h5>
<p>1.	Put the accentual marks at the right place for the following sentences.</p>
<p>2.	This is the house we bought last week.</p>
<p>3.	Yes, he will.</p>
<p>4.	Would you like it painted green.</p>

                                                            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Intonation</h3>
<h3>5.5	Definition </h3>
<p>The degree of highness and lowness of voice while speaking is called pitch. A single sound of certain duration is called note. The tone represents the quality of feeling, authenticity and musicality of a speech.   The primary accent is called tonic accent and secondary accent is called non- tonic accent. In a sentence there may be any number of syllables but the prominent syllables receive accent and others do not.  Only one syllable receives the primary accent and others receive secondary accent. The choice of the primary accent depends upon the speaker.</p>
<p>Intonation is related to the pitch of the voice. During the articulation of words or phrases the vocal chords vibrate, when they vibrate a musical note is produced which is called voice. The vocal cords   are capable of vibrating at various rates. The number cycles per second at which they vibrate is called the frequency of vibration, which determines s the pitch of the voice. It is evident Higher the frequency, the higher the pitch and vice versa. All the time, no language is spoken on the same musical note. In normal speech, the pitch of our voice goes on changing constantly.  Now going up, now going down and sometimes remaining steady. Different pitches of the voice combine to form patterns of pitch variation, which together constitute the intonation of a language.  The intonation of a language refers to the pitch variation and it uses in its utterance.</p>
<h4>5.5.1	Functions of Intonation:</h4>
<p>Intonation performs certain functions. They are grammatical function, attitudinal function and accentual function.</p>
<p>Intonation distinguishes different types of sentences. The below given sentences are grammatically identical but when uttered the change is seen.</p>
<p>1.	Ravi is ar ‘riving ‘late. (Statement)</p>
<p>2.	Ravi is ar’riving, late?  (Question).  </p>
<p>3.	‘Shut the ‘door.(command )</p>
<p>4.	‘Shut  the ,door.(request)</p>

<h4>5.5.2	Attitudinal function:  </h4>
<p>Intonation elicits the attitude of the speaker. It denotes whether the speaker’s emotions are natural polite, incredulity, querulous etc.</p> <p>Intonation makes distinction of meaning to which grammar gives no structural clues.</p>
<p>1.	‘When can you ‘come?</p>
<p>2.	‘When can you, come?</p>
<p>3.	‘Ramesh is ‘very ‘good.</p>
<p>4.	‘Ramesh is ‘very good?</p>
<p>5.	‘Thank you.</p>
<p>6.	‘He’ll ‘fall.</p>
<p>7.	He’llv fall. </p>

<p>In the above, the first sentence is normal question, the second sentence is in the raising tone, and it expresses politeness. The third sentence is in the falling tone and is a plain statement. The fourth one is in falling, rising tone, express reservation on the part of the speaker. The fifth sentence expresses a feeling of gratitude. , when said with a falling tone. The sixth sentence is in the falling tone where the speaker is uninterested, the last sentence is said falling –rising tone which expresses the speaker’s concerns for the subject.</p>
<h4>5.5.3	Accentual function: </h4>
 <p>It enables the speaker to make any part of his utterance prominent in accordance with the meaning he would convey. In that context, the primary accent is placed on the last important word in the tone group.</p>
<p>1.	They ‘told me at the, station that the ‘train ‘leaves at ‘seven. </p>                      
<p>2.	‘Who told you, this?</p>
<p>3.	The ‘man at the en’quiry, office, told me to go to platform no7.</p>

<p>In sentence 1 the primary accent (tonic accent) is placed on the stressed syllables of the last important words station and seven. In the second sentence the word who receives the primary accent. In the third sentence the word ‘enquiry’ receives the tonic. It means which word receives the primary accent or tonic accent in a sentence depends up on the mood or context of the speaker.</p>
<p>Uses of Tones: When we speak, we use different sentences and all sentences are not uttered in the same way. There are variations in the pitch of the voice (tone).  According to the types of sentences we use different tones .Every accented syllable is said on a level pitch, high or low and is marked with [ ‘ ]The tones are classified and marked as falling tone [‘], Rising tone[, ] Fallrise [v ] and Rise-fall  [^ ].</p>
