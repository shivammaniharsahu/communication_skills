My most Memorable day of my life-1 First day of my school at Andhra Pradesh
I want to share my memorable experience of my life when I did my schooling at Andhra Pradesh. The very first day l entered the class. I was full of fear at that time. The entire student starting at me as l was different. Those look me different. I don‘t know how to speak Telugu. So l couldn‘t able to interact with them. Whether Telugu teacher came to class. He asked to introduce the new students. When my turn came l couldn‘tBecause the twist was my Telugu teacher told to introduce in Telugu. At that time my situation was very in Telugu.</P>

MY MOST MEMORABLE DAY OF MY LIFE - 2
<p>
The Memorable day of my life is our tour to Shirdi. We went for a trip to the beautiful pilgrimage before 2 years. It was a nice family trip, we enjoyed a lot. The trip started in the evening. We hired a bus and my uncle‘s family accompanied us.</p>
<p>
We boarded a lodge at 9‘0 clock in the very next morning. It was a sunny day and we started with enthusiasm. After refreshment we took the path to the temple. On the way we enjoyed a lot. The life style of people was amazing. And when we reached temple, I was stunned to see the beauty of it. It was a very different theme zone. After worshiping Lord Sai Baba, we had a break for having lunch. That evening we visited the Botanical Garden, The Rose Garden and many other tourist spots nearby. We also had a horse ride, which was an amazing experience. The following day we visited the nearby tourist spots. Thus, we ended our journey.</p>
<p>
It was a pleasant experience, since we enjoyed a lot altogether. This trip was definitely one of the most memorable ones of my life.</p>

MY MOST MEMORABLE DAY OF MY LIFE - 3</h3>
<p>
The most difficult job on this planet is to be a human being. I am not at all being sarcastic by any means. The human mind is so diverse, that to pick up one memorable moment is like searching for a pin in a haystack.
Done with the proverbs and all, I express my thanks and I won't disappoint you. I have had a life full of twists and turn .And to think of that very moment makes me go nostalgic. It was the month of July last year; I was huffing and putting through my regular chores. Class 12th was all over me. And thencame the moment I have been waiting for. I had been continuously improving my football skills and being a part of the school team since 8th always helped me to learn to tackle difficult situations. I have always dreamt of captaining my school team. And that day finally arrived. To be the school football team's captain was overwhelming to say the least. Our school always took pride in its sports activities. I was so gutted to not win the trophy for the past three years. And I knew this was my last chance to get the silverware and bow out of my school life with pride.</p>
<p>
It wasn‘t long before the tournament started, and we were ready to take on anyone. First match is always crucial for any team to set the tone right, and what happened was a complete disaster. We were completely outplayed and lost 2-0 and all the confidence we had in the build up to the competition was shattered. I was shattered to bits, but I knew that I have to pick myself up because my team needed me. I gained courage and took it upon myself to turn this upside down. I told my team that we were still the best and I want us to play the final, which seemed unimaginable at that point. The guys had faith in me and promised me that they will get better. Ten days later, the picture had completely changed; the final whistle blew signalling the end of our last league match. Unbelievably we went on to win 5 straight games after losing the first one.</p>
<p>
The confidence was oozing and we wanted to go all the way. The final was still 15 days away and we knew that we had it in ourselves to beat anyone. But you can never underestimate life. One day before the final, I took a knock down while practicing. My left wrist felt the knock and it was badly swollen. I didn‘t pay much attention as my only focus was to win tomorrow. I never knew that next day would be even worse for me. The match began and I was slowly getting into my rhythm. In a blink of the eye, I took a knock from the rival team's defender as I was approaching the goal, and was down moaning in pain. I had dislocated my left wrist, the same part that took a knock yesterday .I was rushed to the hospital. Amidst all the pain, I still remember asking my teacher what is the score. I knew even this cannot come between me and my glory. I reached the hospital and was rushed to the operation theatre..2 hours later when I got back my conscious, I asked the same question, ―Sir what happened?‘ He responded with a smile on his face, ―We won 2-1 after trailing 1-0 at half time‖. And this very moment has been the most memorable day in my life. My team did this for me, and when I see those pictures from my team's trophy presentation, I don‘t see myself.</p>

MY MOST MEMORABLE DAY OF MY LIFE - 4

<p>
There are days in our life memories of which make us delighted. One such day of my life is my visit to Sun Temple in Konark situated in heart of Odisha. It was the third day of our trip when I got the opportunity to visit this place. Apart from the place itself the journey to it was also enjoyable and exciting.</p>
</p>
During the journey as it was a car trip we travelled along the road for a lot of time passing through the woods and many cultural places which were beautiful enough to fill eyes of every viewer with eyegasms.We also met with the local people and gained some useful information about the place we have already visited and the places that we have to visit. One thing that I like the most about those people was that they are humble and kind hearted, they treat every tourist as their guest and converse with them in such a manner that the listener for a moment will forget that he or she is talking to a person
<p>
whom he or she never met with before. Travelling through the road I also witnessed developed and technologically advanced part of Odisha. While we travelled through high buildings, bridges and industries shifting from less developed side of Odisha to developed one was not that much different because the people living in the developed parts of the Odisha have same humbleness and generosity as the one we met .One thing that fascinated me most was that as we were travelling along the road we encountered negligible traffic jams which is common in the roads of developing states of India like Odisha. I thought that it was because that the traffic management officers were working hard to regulate the traffic jams.</p>
<p>
After travelling a long way we finally reached the temple of Konark. By the time I was very much tiered and exhausted but after seeing the magnificent beauty of the temple I become cheerful again. I find the temple to resemble the chariot of Sun god and what was more astonishing was that the entire temple is made by using single stone. The environment of the place was peaceful and at the same time arousing curiosity of the visitors about its hiding mystries. I roamed around touching its neatly carved floral, geometrical pattern, bird and mythical creatures trying to imagine the genius of its builders who were 1200 artisans following commands of King Narsinghdev of 13th   century. Even in partially ruined sate its majestic beauty leave me stunned.</p>
<p>
Then it was time to go but I was feeling nostalgic .Outside the gate there was plenty of ice- creams and coconut I quenched my thirst with fresh coconut water and moved out of the place ending one of the ever memorable days of my life with sweet memories.</p>

MY MOST MEMORABLE DAY OF MY LIFE - 5</h3>
<p>
I belong to little known town Chapa. From my childhood, I have always been taught to take pride in small things. My most memorable day might not be full of fun, but I love it.</p>
<p>
It was the day of Gurunanak Jayanti last year. I had my tuition classes in the gurudwara.i had many friends there. I went to the tution as always. As I reached there I along with my friends were greeted with pleasure by our teacher. Little did we know that it was just the start. I knew only a little about Gurunanak Jayanti. Our teacher firstly told us about the importance of the festival among Sikhs. Then we were told the importance of faith in God and to work for him is the best deed possible. I was so happy to hear all this and wanted to help the gurudwara. I with their chores. We were told to pray and take part in the prayers. It was very soothing to the mind. Then we volunteered in the langar and helped to feed the poor on this prestige occasion.</p>
<p>
After the completion of langar , we were all thanked and awarded with a treat of our own. All my friends and I ate the treat and enjoyed a lot.
We got to know about Gurunanak Jayanti and enjoyed a lot. It was certainly a memorable moment. The most memorable day of my life-6
The most memorable day of my life was the day when I entered NIT for the first time as its student. After cracking one of the toughest exams of engineering aspirants successfully and after so much
counselling I got chemical branch in NIT. It was a moment of great joy and proud for me. Though I had higher expectations but at the end what I got as a result of my hard work was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>
I entered the college with great enthusiasm and a proud feeling of being an NITian. Now I was no longer a school boy. The lush green campus of college greatly attracted me as I was gazing while walking on my way to the main building. I could see hundreds of students like me from various different places of different colors, standing in the campus. It was quite a weird moment for me to stand in crowd of hundreds of people and knowing no one.
Induction program was organised on first day of convocation of B-tech 1st   semester students. we were sent in different classes according to our branches by various faculty members of college. We were introduced to the facilities, curriculum and specialities of college. It was quite interesting to know about it. However more amazing experience for me was to interact with my batch mates sitting round me. I still remember my interesting conversation with my mate chinmay and bhavesh on first day. They were really cool, humorous and more importantly of same ideas about life as I have. It was good to find someone who in crowd shares a great similarity of thoughts with you. We had lunch in canteen that day and we emerged out as good friends. In their cheerful company I didn‘t feel the time passing by. It was finally 6 pm when we were leaving from college and still gossiping. Really it was the most memorable  day for me!!</p>

The ever Memorable day of my life was when I went to Shimla for a tour. It was very great experience. I loved the beauty of that place. I was surprised by the by the natural forest and wildlife present there. It was very much cold there and when I wake up I could see the natural beauty and the snow falling in the mountain from the Window of my room in the hotel where we were staying. I and my family went there and had a lot of fun. From the top of the Mountain it seemed that I could see overview of the whole city in front of my eyes and I could see the whole mountain covered with snow. I and my brother played a lot with a lot with the snow it was really looking good and was very unusual experience for us. Also we came to know about the different cultures of those places. We also visited a lot of temples in that places one of the famous temple is the Hidimba temple which was made in ancient Times and was very old and in a great condition. I wish if I can go there and once again take the fun of that place. For me that was my greatest experience and the most memorable day in my life.</p>
