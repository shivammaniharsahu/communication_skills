<h3>3.2	Definition</h3>
<p>On splitting the word debate we get where “De” means negating “Bate” – which means angry in mood– Debate should be something that is negates an angry mood. But it’s not like that; debating for ages has been taken too literally owing to its hold Etymology. While the word has derived from Latin word “dis-battere”, which means to clash or a strictly logical mutual discussion upon a certain subject or familiarize with their perspective or their aspect of the matter in concern and hence it proves helpful in learning how to put your views in front of other and participate actively in discussions. In other words, debating aims at coming at a conclusive notion on the topic. Some may be supporting or against what the subject matter stands to propose, this is a perfect way to encourage the language use among the participants. Some new ideas and new words come out and even it can prove to be a good tutorial to learn how healthy discussions can take place and how effectively we can keep our view in front of other. We must understand that debating is far better than a full fledged argument to prove superiority of one over the other. Aim of debating is to reflect the mindly health of participants in the process and help them to intellectually refine their thoughts. It helps the participants to become a confident and audacious person. And it will assist the participants to develop a political identity. It will help to boost participant’s confidence and speak boldly without hesitation. Debate is a social way of expression you’re thought and also helps to accept others point of view. It also helps learn to agree and disagree with, dignity and even compromise with others.</p>
<p>Indeed a debater aims at proving his point through the art of persuasive speaking, ie, by using the tools of deliberative rhetoric. However, this demands from one a certain quality of ethos (one of the tools as alluded to above) that the debater may appeal to the masses with a reliable credibility. This quality refers to the intellectual maturity of the debater (although it literally means whether or not the speaker holds a portfolio of much gravity, yet the audience are enough appealed to by the bearing of much convincing logos, or logic, in the debater’s appeal; they reflect of intellect and maturity in a debater’s approach thus serves for the ethos meant to convince the house of his ethical credibility). It is essential for one to develop on his intellectual capacity to evolve into a purposeful debater of much adept. It is necessary for debaters to understand the aim and purpose. Debating is not just, addressing the problems but it is responsibility of debater to dissolve the question till we reach the solution.</p>

<h4>3.3.1	We must understand that debates are not...</h4>
<p>1.	Debates are not wars but process of coming to unanimous decision.</p>
<p>2.	Debates are not arguments but a platform which is provided to keep our views and thoughts about the concerned topic.</p>

<h4>3.3.2	We must always remember…</h4>
One must always learn more from a person who disagrees with you than from one who agrees with you.
<h3>3.4	How to Conduct a Class Debate</h3>

<p>1.	Introduce the topic</p>
<p>All debates start with an introduction of topic, or resolution. Choose a subject to which participants can relate. Once the participants are clear with the topic, go through the specialized vocabulary that goes with it.</p>

<p>2.	Assign the Affirmative and the Negative</p>
<p>One will argue for and another will be against the resolution. Always there are two sides to any debate. So it is best to group participants into teams for further research and argue the issue. </p>

<p>3.	Give Time for Research</p>
<p>Participants must be given some time to research on the issue. If some additional instructions are required they must be informed and must be sure that they understood. Encourage all participants to form a strategy during; the preparation time in anticipation of the rebuttal must be made.</p>

<p>4.	Keep Track of Time</p>
<p>Allot time to participants to speak and keep their points and convince with their points. </p>

<p>5.	Make a Judgment</p>
<p>Usually in debate, the winner is the one who has presented the strongest case. For ESL classes, the overall purpose of speaking is more important than the specific outcome of the debate. Still, your students will probably want to know who won. To determine the winner, have the audience vote on which team they thought made the most convincing argument. With this, weigh your own opinion as to who communicated clearly and refuted the opponent’s arguments best. This combination will identify your winners.</p>
<p>Your grading process, on the other hand, does not have to name a winner and a loser. As long as your students were able to communicate clearly, use good grammar, and have good pronunciation, the debate was a success, and their grades should reflect that success.</p>
<h3>3.5	Qualities Required To Be Good Debater</h3>

<h4>3.5.1	Be a better critical thinker</h4>
<p>While you might not debate on a day-to-day basis, chances are you will get involved in small disagreements and differences of opinion. Debating, instead of arguing, can help you defuse a rapidly escalating situation. Rather than raising your voice, take a step back and choose your words wisely.</p>
<p>Debating helps you to develop essential critical thinking skills – the ability to make reasoned and well thought out arguments in addition to questioning the evidence behind a particular stance or conclusion. Critical thinking will help you become curious about new ideas while also retaining a level of skepticism and building a healthy attitude to questioning. It will also help you to become more humble – well, you can’t be right all the time! </p>
<h4>3.5.2	Articulate your thoughts</h4>
<p>Ever had that feeling when you just can’t get your words out quickly enough? Debating can help you become even better at explaining a whole variety of topics. From explaining complex mathematical equations to the plotline of your favorite book, debating helps you to identify your audience and choose the appropriate tone. Too formal a tone will only alienate you from your listeners, while being too relaxed might undermine your own arguments. The ability to articulate and plan your thoughts is key in debating, producing a well- planned out and sharp argument.</p>
<h4>3.5.3	Education is key</h4>
<p>In any debate the argument matters, even if you don’t agree with it on principle. The manner in which you deliver your winning speech is also incredibly important: keeping calm and maintaining eye contact are all proven as effective debating techniques. Last but not least is the method in which you put your debate together. Are your arguments coherent? Do they make sense?</p>
<p>A good debater will keep all of these in mind in addition to the core elements they have acquired through education (reading and finding sources, writing and drafting a speech, speaking confidently and being able to listen) – useful both inside and outside the classroom. </p>
<h4>3.5.4	Think on your feet</h4>
<p>Think outside of the box, challenge your opponent and be ready to identify any loopholes in their counter-argument. The ability to think on your feet and respond to questions and comments is essential while debating – hesitating could cost you precious time and points. In fact, the ability to think on your feet could stand you in good stead in any situation which life throws at you, when time is of the essence and a decision needs to be made fast.</p>
<h4>3.5.5	Conflict resolution</h4>
<p>A good debater will remain focused and won’t stray from the issue they are discussing. Just like any successful orator, remember who it is you want to keep on side, and present a personable argument – you will appear instantly much more amenable and likeable. Knowing how to lose graciously and accept your failings are important skills, both in debating and during everyday life. This will also help resolve any conflicts before they have a chance to begin. So, accept any criticism that comes your way. It will make you a much more polished and proficient speaker – and human being – in the long term.</p>
<h4>3.5.6	Show some empathy</h4>
<p>A successful speaker will always maintain a degree of empathy while debating – you might not believe in what you have been assigned, but empathy will help you understand and accept the beliefs of others. Nobody is asking you to agree with the other party’s argument, but empathy is an important life skill, helping you to improve your relations on a personal and professional level.</p>
<h4>3.5.7	Keep your emotions in check</h4>
<p>A good debater will also remember to retain an element of poise and composure – addressing the issue rather than getting carried away emotionally. In fact, managing your emotions will not only stand you in good stead while debating. It is no easy skill to manage, but will gain you respect in every walk of life.</p>
<h4>3.5.8	Construct meaning out of complex situations</h4>
<p>Debating will also help you learn how to construct meaning out of, what are usually, rather complex topics. From world peace to banning nuclear energy, taking the time to research the subject and carefully construct the points you want to make will help you construct a better argument.</p>
<p>Finding solutions to a previous problem and compiling creative solutions and ideas are also key skills for any good debater. Thinking outside of the box and making the best of a bad situation are excellent traits to have, meaning you are prepared and ready to take on any challenge, no matter what the size.</p>
<h4>3.5.9	Presentation skills</h4>
<p>Presentation plays a crucial part in how others perceive you as an individual, and more importantly, as competition. Consider what you are going to say, speak slowly and with clear enunciation. It will make for better reasoning and a clearer understanding of what you say. Good presentation skills will earn you instant respect both while debating and in future situations.</p>
<h4>3.5.10	Confidence boost</h4>
<p>Good presentation skills will also help boost confidence – helping you to shine at interviews or work related events. If you are confident you feel more able to take on increased responsibility and even take some risks – helping you to stand out as an individual. A polished overall presentation and confident speaking manner will make you a memorable individual.</p>
<h4>3.5.11	Be more socially conscious</h4>
<p>Debating is a skill which requires any individual to be much more politically and socially aware of current affairs. In fact, debating also requires you to address a whole range of diverse social issues and viewpoints. Being more socially and politically aware is not only important while debating but it will also ensure that you connect and relate better to others, both socially and in the workplace. </p>


<h4>3.5.12	An expanded worldview</h4>
<p>Debating not only touches on political and social topics, it can also help individuals acquire a totally different worldview too. Debating means students study topics that they wouldn’t normally consider, meaning they have a deeper understanding of the society and the world which we live in. An expanded worldview also encourages students to be proud of their talents and achievements, in addition to being more appreciative of the opportunities that await them.</p>
