<h3>

Also I wanted incur reuse and recycling of different parts of equipment which are classified as junk
My goal is to complete my b tech in biomedical engineering and then to clear GRE. I want to complete my MS and Ph. D from a good college.</p>

<h3>
About my-Self</h3>
<p>
Thank you for giving this opportunity to introduce myself. My strength is I am a quick learner and I am so confident, honestly do my work, and hardworking + smart working. My hobbies are new innovation and spending time with friends.I believe easily others.</p>
<h3>
Introducing Myself</h3>
<p>
My  name  is  Mr.  Pramod.  I  am  from  Hyderabad.  I  am  currently  doing  my  3rd     year  in  Chemical Engineering from NIT Raipur. Sometimes it is hard to tell about yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. No matter what even if it excites me or not my policy in life is take life as it comes. But this has caused tremendous decrease in my marks at times. Still as far as I am considered this is the best quality I am having.</p>
<p>
I have a great passion to Dance especially to classical dance. This is the one thing I can always do even if I am physically not well. Other than Dance my other talents are Public speaking and Acting.
And in a very low scale I do sing. My mom used to say ―Participation is more important than winning‖ since my kindergarten. This has made me more progressive in many aspects. On the other side I am very bad in sports. But at the same time if someone ask me to participate in any sports activity I will do  it without any fear. Because I fear stage the least.</p>
<p>
I am a very patriotic person. And this is why I would like to serve my country by becoming a public servant. My aim is to become an IAS officer. I am very typical about environment. I like to do make my surroundings eco friendly. I think being an IAS officer I can accomplish all my dreams.</p>
<h3>
My goal</h3>
<p>
Completion of B. Tech in Chemical engineering.
Clearing CAT exam and completion of MBA in any good college. Cracking civil service examination.
My mission
My mission is to serve the people all over India through the three lettered word power after my name with accomplishing IAS cadre. I want to go down to those people who don‘t even get the basic right that we get hear them out consolidate them and come up with a more substantial solution.
To create an eco friendly zone which includes: Reduce recycle and reuse of almost all the
Items we use
Planting of trees and plants around your home
Ensuring that every family has a vegetable garden on their own My vision
Be a truthfully and loyal IAS officer.</p>

Inspiring Person in My Life
<p>
The most inspiring person in my life is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, one such grand human being whose achievements, humility, sincerity, hard work and never give up outlook had and would always impart a great moral fillip for all at every stages of life.</p>
<p>
He was born in a poor family in Rameshwaram. When family conditions became a villain in his life he started selling newspaper and continued his studies which shows us his utmost dedication for studies. No doubt he became the 11th  president of India along with many honours.</p>
<p>
The character of him which inspired the most is never give up outlook. When we have a never give up character it creates a positive aura around us that will make us fight till the end. Dr. Kalam was one gallant fighter since his childhood and his bravery to face challenges with a smile right as a kid made me him the best person for me. ―End is not the end in fact END mean Effort Never Dies- If you get
No as an answer remember NO means Next Opportunity. So let‘s be positive‖ the most inspirational saying I have ever heard in my life.</p>
<p>
Throughout his life, this great man has taught to keep on with endeavours to fulfil the dreams in life. Every Indian will remember three words said by him Dream Dream Dream. He always encouraged never to get bogged down by failures but to continue looking for the opportunities that will ultimately lead to the ray of light.</p>
<p> life always reminds me to be humble. It is equally important to be humble as perseverance to conquer is. He had always been pro active in getting down from podium and interacting directly with the people below, mostly kids and students. Always a believer of simplicity, he stayed unfazed by the luxuries around.</p>
<p>
For me he is an impeccable person. He was born in India lived in India and died in India. He always used to say that the new generation is the nation and he has worked so hard for the welfare of every Indian. If someone is asking me the greatest loss in my life that I cannot regain in my life, I will say I have not met Dr. Kalam sir and won‘t be able to meet again. But he has always been in my life, in every worst situation of my life through his speeches and books. He will always lie immortal in mine as well as all the Indians life because he is one of a kind.</p>
<p>
