	 <div class="jumbotron">
<h3>Mechanics of Note Making:</h3>
<p>
Note making is a skill to write down appropriate key points of a written material for further use. Note making is an organized method of recording and systematizing notes than note taking. Notes are taken down quickly and hence, lack of proper planning and structure may adversely affect. Note taking is more suitable while listening to lectures, presentations or for meetings, while note making is more appropriate for a written text.</p>
<h3>
Purpose:</h3>
<p>
We commonly make notes to read a book, write an article, a research paper or to prepare an essay. You put things into your own words or abridge them as well as to emphasize the key points.</p>
<h3>
Utility:</h3>
<p>
Note making is highly constructive at work places too, as it not only helps in writing reports but also in recording the major points of previously written report. At the same time notes can be used for future use like improvising, forwarding or recalling information.</p>
<h3>
Mechanism:</h3>
<p>
When one starts with note making, the two most important aspects that one has to consider are
which points should be included and which should be excluded.</p>

<p>
Read the passage or article carefully.
Give heading to passage
Examine the major thought of the passage
Framing of heading and subheadings based on the central theme
Scrutinize how main theme is being developed.
Analyze subordinate themes in the passage.
Framing of subheadings.
Analyze further details and other points e.g. subtitles
Care about margin with indent i.e. with suitable space and number must be followed.</p>

<h3>
Steps Involved in Note Making</h3>

Step I

While making notes keep the following points in mind: scan the text smartly to grasp its general idea, idea and key points. At the same time take notes for further use. Read it again, this time more carefully, to find out the development of idea, the main divisions/chapters/sections of the text and their mutual relationships.

Step2<p>
Write down the major points and the sub points in the order as they come into view in the text. Also note down core ideas and keywords used while reading or listening for effectual note-making. Get acquainted with new words, terms and language in use.</p>

Step3<p>
Rephrase the foremost points and sub-points into shorter phrases or may be into single words. Use schematizing example: using tables, graphic representation, Use of standard abbreviations which helps to save time. First few letters of words and phrases can be the functional abbreviations that may be easily understood later also.</p>
<p>Example:	Volume – vol.</p>
<p>Especially – esp. Secretary – secy. That is – i.e.</p>
<p>Increase -↑ Decrease -↓</p>
<h3>

NOTE WRITING TECHNIQUES</h3>

<h2>
TOPICALISING </h2>Main points and central idea should be rephrased in points. Redundant words and phrases are to be removed.
<h2>
SCHEMATIZING:</h2> Scientific and technical texts may contain forms or figures, classification, contrasts, processes and so on. So we can schematize notes.
<h2>
SEQUENCING:</h2> This refers to the process of making a clear layout for fast and accurate interpretation of notes.
.
Use numerals/ letters/ Roman numerals – I, II, III for the main ideas
Capital letters - A, B, C, D for main sub divisions
Arabic numbers – 1, 2, 3, 4 for minor divisions
Small letters - a, b, c, d for further sub divisions
Small Roman letters - i, ii, iii, iv for further sub divisions
<h3>
REDUCTION DEVICES</h3>
Meaning

This is an essential part in making effective note-taking. This saves time while you are noting down. They are essentially helpful while taking down notes, because it is very hard to match the speaker. Since notes do not include recurring and needless information, reduction devices give a more planned and well structured picture.

Some useful devices

<h3>
USE OF ABBREVIATION

Min. for Minute
Sec. for second
Wk. for Week
Hr. for hour
Yr. for Year
K.g for Kilogram
i.e for that is
e.g. for example
etc. for etcetera
</h3>
<h3>

USE OF SHORT FORMS</h3>
Shortening of words eg -tion or -sion at the end of a word

e.g. Reaction – reactn.

Conclusion - conclusn.
<h3>
SUMMARIZING AND PARAPHRASING</h3>

DEFINITION<P>

</p>
<h3>
PARAPHRASING</h3>


DEFINITION
<p>
Paraphrasing is a phenomenon where in one uses a passage or text of original work into his /her words. Paraphrasing is generally shorter than the original work as they are more in condensed form. Whereas summarizing to putting one‘s own ideas and thought into one‘s own words. The terms paraphrasing and summarizing are often confusing to students. Paraphrasing and summarizing are both vital writing tools. Both of these phenomenon helps to use other writers‘ works into one‘s writing using one‘s own words.</p>
<h3>
IMPORTANCES OF PARAPHRASING ARE AS FOLLOWS.</h3>
<p>
To provide support to your own ideas
To give reasons of why you agree or disagree with something
To give depth to your writing
To refer to something that led to your ideas</p>
<h3>
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARAPHRASING AND SUMMARIZING</h3>
<p>
Paraphrasing is the phenomenon of re-writing similar thoughts and ideas of others into one‘s own language without altering the meaning another writer‘s words or ideas in your own words without altering the meaning. Paraphrasing is not shortening the text but to rephrase the text without leaving anything behind. Whereas summarizing, is noting down the main themes and ideas of somebody else‘s work into your own words. The foremost difference is summary is shorter about one-third of the original text as it includes framework.
</p>

<h3>
PARAPHRASE WHEN	SUMMARIZE WHEN</h3>
<p>
One want to use another‘s words without plagiarism	You need is to only identify the main theme
You need to use words of someone without the use of quotes	You just want to present an general idea of the topic
The ideas of the other writer are more important than his/her style	You want to simplify a complex argument
Sometimes you think that some words used by writer are too difficult to
understand	You want to concentrate the matter which suits your requirement
</p>

<h3>
TIPS ON EFFECTIVE PARAPHRASING: DOS‘ AND DONTS‘</h3>
<P>
Read the text several times until you understand the meaning clearly.
Without looking at the source, jot down in points whatever you have understood from the text.
Rewrite the points using your own words, but without altering the meaning.
Comparison of both original and paraphrased text must be done to make sure that few similar words are taken.
Always use quotation marks whenever necessary.
Always Cite source which have been used.</P><p>
TECHNIQUES OF PARAPHRASING CHANGE FROM A CLAUSE TO A PHRASE (OR VİCE VERSA)</p><p>

After playing, Danny took a nap.</P>
<P><h3>
CHANGE FROM QUOTED SPEECH TO INDIRECT SPEECH (OR VİCE VERSA)</h3>

<P>
	USE AN ADVERB INSTEAD OF AN ADJECTIVE OR USE A VERB TO REPLACE A NOUN.</P>

<h3>
OUTLINING AND PARAPHRASING</h3>

DEFINITION<P>
An outline is planning to follow, when writing a composition, a speech or a report. It organizes material in a logical way into main idea, supporting ideas and supporting details. When you are ready to turn your ideas into outline, remember each idea and topic becomes main topic of the outline. Outlining encourages you to compose the data in a section and the rundown causes you recall the vital parts.</P>
<h3>
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUTLINING AND PARAPHRASING</h3>

<P>
An outline is ordinarily as a rundown isolated into headings and subheadings that recognize  fundamental focuses on supporting focuses. An outline is an arrangement for or a synopsis of a written work venture or discourse. All the main topics will be indicated by numerals. Subtopics will be noted by letters and sub details are noted by Arabic numbers. Note that successful paraphrasing requires the use of multiple techniques each time. It is not sufficient to simply replace the keywords with synonyms and in fact this is a common mistake among students learning to paraphrase. Changing the structure of the sentence is also important to fit the sentence into your paragraph effectively and also giving credit to the source.
