		Exercise-1

<p>Life is like water, as water is transparent, life is transparent to everyone. Life has two tastes that is success and failure. None of this can hide for a long time. Everyone have to taste both in their life. If you want to get success in your life then never give up on your dreams and work hard for whatever you want from your life. Not everyone can get success in their first attempt so it does not mean that you will never get success in your life, its mean that you have to do more hard work.</p>

<p>Every new morning gives you a new opportunity to achieve your small goal and this will help you to achieve your bigger dreams and you will get your dreams Not immediately but definitely because great things take time....</p>

<li>Exercise-2</li>
<p>What is life? Life is nothing but a poor walking shadow said Shakespeare. What is this life, full of care said W.H. Davies.</p>

<p>But what is the essence of human life or what is the reason or aim for the creation of this life. It is the most complicated question to ask and it is more difficult to choose an appropriate answer for it. Because life is different for everyone and everyone has their own meaning of life. For some it is gift of god, for some it is beauty of nature, for some it is a series of challenges they face etc. All this can be a part of life but life is not in it. Life is in living. It is a process. It is not bound with anything. There is no way to attain to life except by living it, except just by being alive and flowing with it.</p>
<p>
Our life is like an irregular stone. That has to give shape to form a perfect statue. There are many people who will tell you about your incapability or abilities. But its only you who can go on self discovery and find what you can do and what are your abilities that are being missed by others. By this you can create a masterpiece of your own. All of us have dreams to become something in life. And we all have got many opportunities that match our goals. We all seek for something that keeps us happy for long term. But we don‘t work for it. All we have to do is work on our dreams. By doing this we can get so many experiences, we can learn from life and so many things that would be helpful in a happy life.appropriate</p>
<P>
And lastly, just be kind to others. No matter what difficulties you face in life. Never let the worry reflect in your day-to-day conduct. Live happily, love everyone and be kind to all. And most importantly face life with an evergreen smile on your face.</p>
<li>Exercise-3</li>

<p>In life we should live each moment happily. Life gives us many situations from which learn so many things. There are so many worst situations in life but our positivity and strength gives us hope to come out from that situation. We should live life according to right opinion and strategies we have made in our mind. We shouldn‘t get divert from others opinion until justification. We should try to do all things in life which we want, at least once, in order to prove ourselves. Life gives us both hopes and disappointments .Life is full of challenges. In every aspects of life we are facing challenges .In three words I can define life as life goes on means it never stops .After every dusk, comes the dawn.</p>

<p>So, in spite of getting frustrated we should try to tackle the situation. Seems life is full of experiences we should try to learn from every experience. Via bad experience we should glean some good out of them. Life is full of desire and fantasies. Dreams give us hope to fulfil our desire. We get many opportunities in life and we should have the capability to use that opportunity to the fullest. We shouldn‘t bother about failure and success. In bad situation we didn‘t lose patience and wait for the correct time. In life before doing any work we should never think of consequences we should only focus on how to work rather than thinking about futile things such as a work complexity and the upcoming problems. For every bad situation it shouldn‘t seems to us that life is giving us a chance, we should handle our situation in such a way that we are giving a chance to life. So we conclude that ―Break the bounds and steal the show‖.</p>
<li>
Exercise-4</li>


<p>People define the life in their own way. Different people have different definition of life. But if I am asked to say something about life then I would like to say that:

―Life is meaningless unless you give it a meaning.</p>
<p>We have observed that there are many great people who have given beautiful definitions of life, but have we focused that their definition of life is based on the situation which they had faced in their life? And accordingly they defined it. But I would like to say that actual definition of life is not so easy to describe, because the life treats in the same way how we want to perceive it. So it depends on our vision towards it. Life shows us different phases till we live. Sometimes we have good moments and sometimes bad also. Good moments make us happy while the bad moments show us the dark side of life. But both the moments have their own consequences but somehow they may also be changed by our attitude of living the life.
</p>
<p>For instance - if someone is passing through the bad phase of life then he may also say that life is not good, so this is his definition of life.</p>

<p>Whereas my definition is that the person who lives all the moments of life weather they are good or bad with the same dedication, is a true life. If we observe carefully then we can find that bad moments make us stronger, these moments prepare us for winning.
</p>
<p>I think that hard phase of life is the important phase of our life because this is the phase during which we come with new powers after facing it.

So it totally depends on our vision.</p>

<p>Here one more thing is there to which I would like to bring your attention that some people try to copy the lifestyle of others not even caring about that they have entirely different life and different situations. ―They don't even think that life has set a different area of problems for them and in an effort to copy them they are also going to lose something different which they could have done. Life is not about copying the others.‖ I personally feel that the person who claims that they know the true meaning of life and say that they have the definition of life, actually they have shared their experience of life, it is not true for all.
</p>
<p>In fact, I can't claim that I know the life, because it is very difficult to say exactly that about what the life is? But in my opinion and on my experience what I have felt about the life I would like to say:</p>

<p>The life is one in which you don't want to lose its single moment to pass without living it from  the core of your heart.
You give a true meaning to your life when you wake up daily with a new passion and have a confidence that yes today I've reached more closer to fulfil my dreams.
If you live each new day with the same energy, as it is your first day.
Life is about to do all those thing that make you complete and make you to feel proud.
Contribute your efforts for the mankind and put your efforts to make place in the people's heart.</p>

</p>This is all, what I think about the life.</p>

<h3>Topic: ON HAPPINESS</h3>

Exercise-1
<p>
If you stay happy even when problems arise then problems become like water bubbles and easily disappear. It is not hard to find true happiness; some people find their happiness in materialism. Is this true happiness? Or a temporary happiness? Definition of happiness for me is the positive feeling that gives me strength to make my life better and make my parents proud of me.
Many people associate success with happiness and they feel that they can be happy only if they are successful which shouldn‘t be the case because success is circumstantial and happiness is not.
You can stay happy even if you don‘t own a big bungalow, huge car or high bank balance, etc. But the important thing is that you must first identify what makes you happy. There are simple rules to stay happy. Enjoy every moment of your life. Live in present. Love what you have. Do your best in both professional and personal life.</p><p>
Happiness is just a happy feeling. Happiness is pleasure and positivity. When I feel good, proud, relieved or satisfied, I feel happy.</p>
<p>
Happiness is a matter of choice. A person can have everything but still may not be happy whereas the other person can have nothing and still be happy. Happiness is and will always be present within ourselves.
The best one lies in making others happy. Seeing others smile makes us happy. Real happiness is about sharing, about giving. If we want the world to be a happy place to live, will first have to be happy ourselves, and by doings so, the whole world will be transformed.</p>


<h3>Topic: ON HABITS</h3>


Exercise-1<p>
Habits
―Motivation is what gets you started but habit is what keeps you going.<p>
All of us have habits. Anything that is done repeatedly becomes a habit. Once we get into a habit we do things without even thinking about it. Habits may be good or bad like rising early, working out, reading books etc., these all comes under good habit while drinking, smoking, using bad language etc. comes under bad habits.</p><p>
So it is necessary to cultivate good habits rather than bad habits. There is a saying that habits are first at cobwebs but later wards cables. This shows that habits might be weak at first, but, once they become strong, they are difficult to break. Hence we should try to acquire only good habits.</p><p>
Everyone respects a man who has good habits. Good habits help one to succeed in life. A person with bad habits is despised and mocked at. In order to cultivate good habits childhood is the right time to start.
Now let‘s talk about how habit works. The routine is the behaviour that you engage automatically in, let‘s say if we go for a walk in the morning we need to wake up, freshen up, cover the distance etc. Now the reward for completing the routine is we stay fit, get fresh air etc.</p><p>
Now in order to get rid of any habit we just need to substitute with another habit. In order to cultivate any good habits we must have strong willpower. To make willpower strong we must do something that requires a lot of a discipline.</p><p>
Now at last we want to conclude out topic by saying that
―We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.‖</p>
Exercise-2<p>

Habits, what are habits. Habit is a behaviour that we usually do in our everyday life.</p>
<p>
It is necessary to cultivate good habits and avoid bad ones. There is a saying that habits are at first cobwebs but after- wards cables. This shows that habits might be weak at first, but, once they become strong, they are difficult to break. Hence we should try to acquire only good habits.</p>
<p>
A person with good habits always gets recognition and one who has bad habits is always criticized. As Aristotle said  that  ―Good  habits  formed at  youth make  all  the  difference‖. So  we must acquire good habits from very beginning because bad habits die hard.</p>
<li>
Exercise-3</li>

Our topic on habits:<p>
I will begin this topic with most popular quotes by Colin Powell: - "If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude."</p><p>
Habits are of two types
Good Habits
Bad habits<p>
Both are done by us in our everyday life. These habits had been beginning from our childhood. Our bad habits give lots of wastage of time and sometimes money and also give mentally trouble. Each bad habits which is repeatedly by us decides bad career.</p><p>
Some of bad habits in life are Sleeping habits, Nail biting, Watching too much TV, Spending too much money, Activeness of too much on social sites etc.These all are also responsible for our bad health which is also bad habit that we don‘t care about our health and fitness during eating foods on street vendor which gives me in trouble as well as my family and also those people who really loves me.
We don‘t change our habits bad immediately even we know that, this is very bad for our life and career. Sometimes it would be changes after long times due to laziness and after realization that thing have lost good opportunity in life to become good to better career.</p><p>
If we continue and improve our good habits and keep repeatedly then again our career is set to better way but this should be done in given time bond because we don‘t have extra time to do something extra in routine of our day-to-day life because every little bit of good and bad habits decides our goal that Can I achieve or not? So my parents‘ wakes up to me early in the morning in childhood so that, this habit will be continue and I will achieve better career in our life because ―My Success is My Parents Success.‖</p>
<h3>
Topic: ON E-MAIL</h3>
<ol><li>Exercises: 1</li>
<p>
Email is Stands for Electronic Mail, Invented by Ray Tomlinson in the year 1960s. It depends on the two medium one is the receiver end and other is Sender end. It can change the Postal world into the Digital World. Email is an Information and Communication Technology, to communicate a digital message from a sender to receiver over the Internet. There are many Software platforms and Application available to send and receive popular emails platforms include Gmail, Hotmail, yahoo! mail.com, outlook and many others.</p>
<p>
Today‘s email system based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages. The person you communicate with could be any other users on the Internet. The email is transmitted between Computer System.</p>
<p>

<p>
The cost nothing is changed for sending and receiving email even thought the message travel across the world.</p>
<p>
Email is system of creating, receiving and storing textual data in digital form over a network. Earlier, Email System is based on Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mechanism, a protocol used in sending the emails from server to another.

<p>
One of the most popular email programs is Gmail.com. The email program has a capability to send and receive email via World Wide Web.</p>
<p>
When you create email account, then we have receive a username and password, that is called as like When you use a postal address our Address is unique identification of us, just like this Id , password provide Software platforms as a Unique Identification.</p>
<li>
Exercise-2: Email</li>
</ol>
<p>Email means electronic mail, is a fast, easy and inexpensive way to communicate with other internet users around the world. That means it is defined as the transmission of massages over communications networks.
Each user of E-mail has a mailbox address to which messages are sent and the mailbox and can be accessed from anywhere and anytime. One can receive and send emails from all systems whether it is a windows pc or a Unix machine.</p>
<p>

No guarantee the mail will be read until the user logs on and checks their email. Hackers can hack the email and can take the personal information.</p>



<h3>Topic: ON DREAMS</h3>
<p>
Dream is a word that everyone is familiar since their childhood. The technical Definition of ‗Dream‘ is it is a series of reflections, illustrations and impressions happening in a person‘s mind during sleep.
</p>
<p>
Basically dreams are of two types. A good dream and a bad dream. Apart from this there is an category of Dream.</p>
<p>
As per my opinion, dream doesn‘t mean only this much. Dreams that we see by our open eyes by just imagine what you be like to and wants to see yourself at some position, are more important than the dreams which we see at night during sleep. It is the dreams only by which someone gets to know that what his aim to do in life is.</p>
<p>
Life should be full of dreams. A person without dream is a person without objective and a person without objective is deadly alive. So keep dreaming and enhance your abilities so as to fulfil all your dreams.
</p>
<p>
Dreams are our biggest asset. Our dreams guide us towards our goals. It is necessary for us to work consistently towards achieving our dreams. The real dreams are the ones which don‘t let us sleep. Many people dream while they are asleep, but success is achieved by those whose dreams don‘t let them sleep. Dreams are nothing but the desires of our heart. It is a famous quote said by Albus Dumbeldore that ―one must not dwell upon their dreams and forget to live‖, this is completely true since dreamsdon‘t always reflect reality. Some dreams are realistic while some are unreal. One must be able to distinguish between which dreams can be achieved and which cannot. If you dream about achieving something you must put in all your efforts and work with dedication to fulfil your dreams. Successful people are those who forget and sacrifice everything to achieve their dreams, their dreams don‘t let them sleep.</p>
<p>
Talking about the scientific side of dreams, dreams are quite mysterious. Some people associate dreams with a peep into the future while other people consider dreams to be just some illusions of mind in its subconscious state. Many people remember few dreams for a lifetime while others forget them within few minutes. The fact that dreams can be associated with future makes it quite an interesting topic. Many studies are also going on about the behaviour of dreams and their association with future.</p>
<p>
At the end we can conclude by saying that we must dream, it is free of cost. But we should also try to achieve those dreams and give our lives a meaning. The one who does not have a dream lives a life without any meaning and goal. When you achieve your dream you get a level of satisfaction and your life gets a meaning. So dream as much as you can and also help others to achieve their dreams.</p>
<h3>
Topic: ON APPEARANCE</h3>
<p>
Hello everyone. Today we are here to present on a topic "Appearance". In today‘s age of 'Science and Technology' appearance plays vital role. Now a days a person is judged according to their clothing and the way appear in front of the world i.e; if you go out being a brand box, people will give you extra attention. But if you are not that well dressed and goes out, people will not give you any kind of attention.</p>
<p>
Listening to this a story strikes my mind which i would like to share with you all. Once there was a young guy nearly in his early 30's. He was full of energy and loved his work very much. So for some</p>
<p>
reason he has to travel somewhere but due to some reason his flight was delayed by an hour. So the guy felt hungry, he went to the donut shop bought 5 donut and picked up a newspaper, paid the money and headed toward the rest area. He rested himself on a chair took off his coat and put is on the chair beside him and started reading the newspaper. After few minutes passed an old man nearly in his mid 60, not so well dressed as he young guy and by look he seems poor, came at beside the young guy. The old man started eating donut; the young guy noticed that the man is eating donut. So the young guy was shocked that how a man without his permission can eat the donut that was bought by him. But the guy did not uer a word but gave a angry look toward the old guy and grabbed a donut from the box from which the old man was eating. The old man completed his 1st donut and went for the 2nd one, seeing this young guy got very angry. The young guy also completed his st donut and went for the 2nd one.</p>
<p>
Now there is only 1 donut in the box, the old man and the young guy both has completed their 2 donuts each. Now the young guy gives an angry look to the old guy, and went for the last donut left in the box. The old man smiled and let the young guy had the last donut. Now the old man got up and started heading toward the exit and again he gave a smile to young guy. The young guy was confused that why the old man was smiling. The old man disappeared in the exit and the young guy again got busy reading the newspaper. Now the flight was declared, the young guy got up and took his coat and was in shock, because under his coat there was the box of donut that he had bought, and the donut that he has eaten were the donut bought by the old man.</p>
<p>
So, friends from the above story I can tell you something that yes appearance plays a vital role but never judge someone based on there appearance. There is a great proverb in English - Never Judge a Book by It's Cover. So never judge someone by their outer looks try to feel the people‘s inner heart because might be that the person who is a brand box have a black heart while a poor person can have a heart of gold.</p>
<h3>
Topic: ON ART
</h3>
<p>
The meaning of Art has not been confirmed yet, although it has many definitions. Art is an action which reflects the hidden talent of any person. It reflects the thousand of ideas and imagination occurring in the mind of person. For example a painter shows his imagination to the audience by drawing it on a paper. A singer or a musician expresses his/her feelings through song or music. Similarly a movie director shows his own thinking or idea or sometimes the story of others in his/her own way through movies. Art acts as a medium, like sometimes if we don‘t have any idea to how to express our feeling in a normal way we express it through our art. A lover sings for her beloved to express his/her feelings and desires, which he/she may hesitate to say directly.
</p>
<p>
As we all know human mind is always a creative one. It is the other thing that this creativity is diminished due our current education system. Art is such a precious thing, that everybody owns it, but very few of them have any clue about that hidden talent or Art. Art is very important in a kid‘s education. It helps them to express themselves in a better way than mathematics and science. Art does not only improve creativity among kids but also help them to improve academic performance.</p><p> Art help

them to overcome their fear of audience, winning the prizes, getting up on the stage, helps them to step outside of their comfort zone and improve their confidence level.<p>

So there is a need to make changes in the current education system of India which does not consider Art as an essential part of education. Also there is a need to change the thinking of people about Art. We should educate people about the importance and benefits of Art in our life.</p>

<h3>Topic: ON CHILDHOOD</h3>

Childhood
<p>
Literally it can be defined as the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. It is the first stage of everybody‘s life. It is the best part of life. It is that precious time in which one live freely without any worries, fear or burden of responsibilities.
</p>
<p>When a child is born parents and family are the first one who shapes the child. Just as potter modules the pot, similarly an individual is modelled during childhood. What a child learn from his surroundings affects his future. If the lessons given to the child are good, the child turns out to be a good one. If it is not, then it has bad effects on his mind. Suit is the responsibility of parents that they taught their child about moral and values, to respect elders, help needy people .It is believe that whatever a child is taught at their stage remains for forever in life. A child has a pure heart and thus he requires only love and care from his surroundings.
</p>
<p>The memories of the childhood have their own place in any individual‘s heart. Everyone wants to go back to those golden days at least once in a lifetime. These memories fill us with a great joy and cheer. We want to go to that places where we had spent our time and also wants to meet the friends of that time. But as these are past things, so we can only wish.</p>
<p>
It is said that children are god‘s gift and the gifts are precious and thus children are. Childhood is the best gift we ever got from God and we also know that money can buy anything and the whole world money is not sufficient to bring back to those days.</p>
<p>
I would like to end up with this quote of Samuel Smiles:</p>
<p>
Childhood, one of the best part of life forever human being. It's name only implied it's meaning. Childhood- full of innocence, full of fun, tension free. It was a golden period of everyone's life. According to me, childhood is the part of life when we all are not concern about future goals like what I will have to do tomorrow? What will happen if I will not wake up tomorrow early in the morning?
It is the time when we are free from all of the real world constraints of social and so many other type of responsibilities. A person is attached to their childhood in different ways. In our childhood we had Doraemon, Shaktimaan, Mowgli, Shinchan, Tom and Jerry which made our day full of excitement and imagination. In short childhood is the magical world where any non living things are alive like fairies and dragons. Childhood is the time whose memories are always alive in our heart.</p>
<p>
Childhood is the happiest stage of a person‘s life. In our childhood, everything seems very easy and we had lot of happiness and joy. A child has the purest heart of any human being. In childhood, everyone gets love and care from their elders. A child‘s work is to eat and play. Everyone has their own share of childhood memories. When a person grows, they miss their childhood and wish to go back in time. A child is innocently made believe that a seed he has eaten by mistake would grow into a tree inside the stomach which terrified the most but it brings laugh in an adults face. A child would play all day long, eat and then has a sound sleep. Children would make fun of each other. Children get involve in silly fights among their friends and siblings.</p>
<p>
Childhood is the phase where a child‘s character is shaped which reflects on future self. Child is taught about basic manners and to be neat and clean. Every child should be given a happy childhood. When a child remains happy, everyone in family is also happy. A child shouts and cry for small things if his demands are not fulfilled.
We should be grateful to our parents that they have given us beautiful childhood as some children can‘t even have their childhood. Many children are involved in child labour and child abuse.
When a person relives his memories of childhood he feels delight like summer vacations, picnic, climbing up a tree, fancy dress competition, homework, etc are the never ending cycle of our childhood memories.</p>

<p>
Challenges Are What Make Life Interesting and Overcoming Them Is What Makes Life Meaningful</p>
<p>
Easy is not an option and challenges are a part of our daily life, without it life is quite meaningless and not worth living. Life is hard and it is all about the courage you have within yourself and doing what is unknown that comes up with new challenges. These challenges will push us out of our comfort zone and we discover something innovative each day. As you go through the challenges of life and you look at it and embrace whatever comes to you and don't run from it you make yourself hard. Most people want it easy, so what‘s easy to come is easy to go. But when you go at what you are going to deal with and you deal with difficulty, when you handle those hard things, take those hard decisions that you don't want to make, learning those things which you don't like to do, but you know that in order to reach where you want to go this is one of the step which you have to go through. If it‘s hard then do it hard. You just have to have faith; you have to believe in yourself, your ability, and your ideas. We have experiences where we had to face challenges and we take the responsibility to do it, to overcomes our fear, to see the best opportunity in that challenge. It is possible for you to create new things and give a positive force in life. Always challenge yourself to learn, to create, to find new paths of life, to innovate and to explore because it brings out the best within you.</p>
<p>
We will face different of challenges every day. Maybe the challenges make our lives uncomfortable and most of us hate them because all of us want to live a comfortable and luxurious life without giving any pain to ourselves. However, if there is no challenge in our lives, our lives will be very boring and we will never be able to improve ourselves.

Topic: CORRUPTION</h3>
<p>
Corruption is a form of dishonesty under taken by a person entrusted by a position of authority often to acquire personal benefit, and also those people who work doing against the rule of government for personal benefit his/her persons are corrupted.</P>
<p>
Corruption are in different form likes black money, scam, political corruption etc. I will address my view point on the political corruption. Ever since the formation of our country, everything is decided by political leaders and people ruling in government sector. Current Scenario we are a democratic country, but whosoever comes into the power tries to misuse that power that for his/her personal gains, for acquiring wealth and luxury.</p>
<p>
In our country the between have and have-nots is so huge that it becomes clear example of corruption in our country where one section of society acquire richness wealth and on the other hand the majority of the masses remain below the poverty line. If we are responsible citizen of our country we should understand that this corruption is eating into our nation's economical growth likes a termite and is giving rise to crime in our society.</p>

Topic: COLORS
</h3>
<p>
Whenever I think about colors, the very first thing in my mind comes is ‗what is our relationship with colors? Colors are the important part of our life. Color is formed due to the reflection of light. Yet I think not everybody react the same way to the same color, because colors influence us on a few different levels. from our childhood to our old age color plays an important role in our life. Life without color is like a body without soul.</p>

<p>As red color concerned with danger, bravery and love. Whereas blue color shows calmness in life. Pink color defines the romance and love; every color shows an importance in our life. At last colors are the important part of our life we can‘t imagine life without colors.</p>

Topic: MY LAPTOP</h3>
<p>
laptop is the part of my life. It is my most favourite appliance and closest to my heart. This is not only because I had strong desire about computers, but may be because I spent my half of the time with it.</p>

<p>Being a MCA student, laptop is the important tool or appliance in my career. This is like a hand to me, if it is not there than I feel like a handicapped, and why not, because it is our future. We as a programmer have to spend our most of the time with it. It becomes a part of our life. I would like to explain an incident which taught me the importance of Laptop in my life. One day my friend takes my laptop to install a game which was not compatible with my laptop configuration. So, it burned my entire hard disk. I lost my entire programs, projects and lab assignments. It took a week to recover my entire hard disk; I had not done new programs for past 4-5 days. So that day I came to know that laptop is very important for my life and career.</p>
