CRITICAL APPRECIATION OF THE NOVEL </center>
	</h2>
<div class="jumbotron">

<h3>
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</h3>
<p>
Novelist:-J. K. Rowling is a British novelist, philanthropist, film producer, television producer and screenwriter, best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. The books have won multiple awards, and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history.</p>
<p>
About the novel:- Characters:-
Newt Scamander- He is the main hero of the story. He is a bit awkward, and a bit eccentric, and a bit outsider, who seems to get on better with animals than humans.
Goldstein- was an author of Magical society. The main actress of the novel. She has been relegated to a lower Unit after standing up for the wrong person. She was ambitious, moral, and is prepared to fight for what she believes in.</p>
<p>
Queenie Goldstein- Tina‘s younger sister was Legilimens; which means we can read people on a deep level, not just their thoughts but all about them. She was brave, wild, and kind hearted. She is my favourite character in the novel.
Jacob Kowalski- He is the side hero of the story. Was an factory worker, with dreams to become a Baker. He get accidentally mixed up in the Newt's world and hence with magical world in New York.
Seraphina Picquery- President of the magical congress of the United States America. She commands the magical Union, was very elegant and Regal.
Credence Barebone- He's a troubled soul with secret magical abilities. Adopted by a lady who criticizes him.</p>
<p>
Outline: As the name suggests the story is related with many kinds of beast. Only four characters are playing major role in the story. The story is entertaining also because of the character of Jacob Cowalski.</p>
<p>
Plot (Major Turning Points) :- the story starts with the entry of newtscamander in the New York city, carrying a secret magical suitcase with himself. The suitcase contains so many fantastic beasts. He came to leave an animal from his home in New York. But due to the fun of one of the animals, he was caught by the author Tina Goldstein. Jacob Cowaski got stuck with him. Then Crednes Brebone suddenly loses control of himself. Newt scamander and Tina bring them under control and save the city.</p>
<p>
Major Concept Of The Novel:- The main concept of the novel is about the Importance of Beasts and the loving nature of Newt Scamander. The magical world is different from the normal world and they want to remain there existence in secret manner.</p>
<p>
Conclusion: Queenie Goldstein played the major role at the end of the story. When Credence Barebone was in the highest destructive mode, even not controlled by aurors, then Scamander came in screen with beasts and cool down the situation with the help of Tina and Queenie. Jacob also played a very important role at the end.</p>
<p>
My Opinion: The whole story is very interesting, not a single time came when I felt boring. It contains everything; I mean entertainment, Adventure, Romance, Seriousness. The most interesting part is about beasts, I mean description of their character was done very nicely. Also some beasts are played very important role in the story. The role of beasts actually make us realize there Importance in our nature. The best character according to me in the novel is of Queenie Goldstein. Her ability was that she can read any person's mind who is in front of her. Apart from this she was very kind-hearted .While reading the I can visualize every incident of the novel.</p>
<p>
Why I Have Selected This Novel: Actually I love the way J K Rowling Describe anything. I had read  her another novel also. Apart from this the name of the novel is very attractive, even at first look it creates fabulous images in our mind. The creatures are very attractive and entertaining. Other novels of J K Rowling are also have this type of stories that I had already read. The main lesson I observed for her novel is about ―Power of Friendship‖. Whatever over objective is we achieve it very easily by group work. It is a fictitious novel but it never seems like a fiction.</p>
<p>
My Appreciation:- I just congratulate the author for this beautiful story. Actually the characters the author has chosen is best suited upon them and the beauty overcomes because of the funny moments in intermediates. The story can entertain a child as well as a old age people. Right from the beginning the story was full of Adventure and maintained till the end, which seems to be nice. The rate of extinction of species is continuously increasing. So, the author creates awareness among the people to save and protect the indentured species. In this way the author is indirectly seeking the attention of people to the global problem.

<h3>
GREAT EXPECTATIONS</h3>
<h4>
By Charles Dickens</h4>
<h4>
NOVEL SUMMARY:</h4>
<p>
Pip was a young orphan living with his sister and her husband Joe in the marshes of Kent.One fine evening pip sat in a cemetery looking at his parents‘ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone and grabs pip from behind and orders him to get food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.</p>
<p>
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of Miss Havisham, who is a wealthy widow with lot of property derived from her late husband. She was extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time.
During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and with contempt. Still, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but all in vain, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common labourer in his family‘s business.</p><p>
With Miss Havisham‘s guidance, Pip is employed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the kind Biddy and encountering Joe‘s malicious day labourer, Orlick. One night, after an argument with Orlick, Pip‘s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news that a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come truethat Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.</p>
<p>
In London, Pip becomes friends with a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers‘s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses contempt for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to love Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert‘s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty- one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying them and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip‘s life, employed as Miss Havisham‘s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick‘sbad past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure comes into Pip‘s room, the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip‘s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip‘s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
<p>
Pip is happy, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch‘s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men‘s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on.</p>
<p>
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch‘s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class boy named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a
visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip‘s forgiveness.</p>
<p>
The time comes for Pip and his friends to help Magwitch escape away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip‘s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch‘s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God‘s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.</p>
<p>
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella‘s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again.</p>

Estella - Miss Havisham‘s beautiful young ward, Estella is Pip‘s love throughout the novel. He loves her passionately but though she sometimes seems to consider him a friend, she is usually cold, cruel, and uninterested in him.

<p>
Miss Havisham - Miss Havisham is the wealthy, eccentric old woman who lives in a manor called Satis House near Pip‘s village. She is manic and often seems insane, flitting around her house in a faded wedding dress, keeping a decaying feast on her table, and surrounding herself with clocks stopped at twenty minutes to nine. As a young woman, Miss Havisham was jilted by her fiancé minutes before her
wedding, and now she has a cruel feeling and hatred against all men. She deliberately raises Estella to be the tool of her revenge, training her beautiful ward to break men‘s hearts.</p>

<h3>
About the Author:</h3><p>
Charles Dickens was an English writer and social critic. During his lifetime, his works enjoyed unprecedented popularity. He is now considered a literary genius because he created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.
Dickens was born on February 7, 1812 in Portsmouth, on the southern coast of England. His father, John Dickens, was a naval clerk who dreamed of becoming rich and his mother, Elizabeth Barrow, aspired to be a teacher and school director. But the family‘s financial situation had grown worse because John Dickens used to spend money dangerously beyond the family‘s means. Consequently, John was sent to prison for debt in 1824, when Charles was just 12 years old.</p>
<p>
After his father's imprisonment, Charles Dickens left school to work in a factory. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.</p>
<p>
Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.</p>
<p>
Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction.</p>
<p>
Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterizations, and social criticism.
On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.</p>
