	<h2>ENGINEERING ETHICS</h2>
	</center>
	 <div class="jumbotron">
<p>	 	
Ethics are values that deal with principles of morality. An engineer with ethics is an individual who is anticipated to possess the ethical integrity along with rich ethical values. The ethics are divided into two types. They are:</p>
<h3>
Consequential Ethics</h3>
<p>
The Consequential ethics where outcome of the actions is judged, on the basis of morality in a particular situation. Example: A lie which saves a life comes under this.</p>

Inconsequential Ethics
<p>
The inconsequential ethics are values go behind where the source of morality comes from the standard values. Example The moral commandment which state that a lie is a lie, and shouldn‘t be done, though it ends in a good deed can be taken as an example of non-consequential ethics.</p>
<h3>
ENGINEERING ETHICS</h3>
<p>
Personal ethics refers to the ethics that a person recognizes with in respect to people and situations that they deal with in everyday life. Professional ethics refers to those ethics that a person must hold on to in respect of their profession.</p>
ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR ENGINEERING ARE
<p>
HONESTY. Engineers must be honest and truthful in all their transactions and they must not intentionally misinform or deceive others by partial truths, overstatements, selective lapse, misrepresentations or any other means.
RELIABILITY. Engineers must display individual truthfulness, veracity and the courage of  their confidence. They will not give up their principle for expediency at any cost.
PROMISE-KEEPING & TRUSTWORTHINESS. Engineers must be worthy to trust. They must make every realistic effort to fulfill undertakes and commitments.
FAITHFULNESS. Engineers must be worthy of faith, demonstrate trustworthiness and loyalty to persons and institutions, devotion to duty; they must never reveal information regarding confidential matters for any personal benefit.

JUSTICE. Engineers must not exercise authority or control impulsively, or neither take any benefit of another‘s mistakes or difficulties.

CONCERN FOR OTHERS. Engineers must be caring, concerned, and benevolent and help those in need, and seek to achieve their Professional objectives in a manner that causes the least harm and the greatest positive good.
</p>
<P>
RESPECTFOR OTHERS. Engineers must always show respect for the human dignity, privacy, rights, and interests of all those who have a stake in their decisions; they must be well-mannered and treat all people with equal respect despite of sex, race or national origin.
LAW ABIDING. Professionals must be abiding by laws, rules and regulations relating to their business activities.
COMMITMENT TO BRILLIANCE. Engineers must chase excellence in performing their duties, are well conversant and prepared, and constantly try to increase their ability in all areas of responsibility.
LEADERSHIP. Engineers must be conscious of the opportunities and responsibilities which come along with their jobs.
REPUTATION AND MORALE. Ethical executives like engineers must protect and build good reputation of themselves and their company.
LIABILITY. Ethical engineers recognize and accept personal liability and accountability for the ethical excellence of their choices.</P>
<h3>
ENGINEERING ETHICS</h3>
<p>
Engineering ethics is the field of system of moral principles that apply to the practice of engineering. The field examines and sets the obligations by engineers to society, to their clients, and to the profession.
</p>
A.	CODE OF ETHICS FOR ENGINEERS
<p>
Hold supreme the security, wellbeing, and welfare of the public.

To execute services only in areas of their proficiency.

Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.

Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.
</p><h3>
Avoid illusory acts.</h3>
<p>
Conduct themselves honourably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession.
Engineers shall support only those engineering credentials that are in compliance with applicable standards.
Engineers must not disclose fact or other information without the previous permission of the client or employer with the exception of authority or as required by law or this Code.</p>
<p>
Engineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents dealing with subject matter in which they lack proficiency.
Engineers shall not solicit or accept financial or other valuable consideration, directly or indirectly, from outside agents in connection with the work for which they are responsible.
They shall not offer any gift or other valuable consideration in order to secure work. They shall
not pay a commission, percentage, or brokerage fee in order to secure work, except to a bona fide employee or bona fide established commercial or marketing agencies retained by the
Engineers are encouraged to adhere to the principles of sustainable development1 in order to protect the environment for future generations.
Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers and should
keep current in their specialty fields by engaging in professional practice, participating in continuing education courses, reading in the technical literature, and attending professional meetings and seminars.</p>
<h3>
PROFESSIONALISM</h3>
<p>
Professionalism covers broadly all areas of practice of a particular profession. It requires expertise and proficiency involved in engineering profession. Professionalism implies a certain set of outlook. The desirable character traits are
Public welfare

Proficiency

Team work

Self-governance qualities</p>
<h3>
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ETHICS</h3>
<p>
PERSONAL ETHICS: Ethics which refers to the principles that a person recognizes with in respect to community and situations in day today life.
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS: Ethics which refers to the principles that a person must stick on to in respect of their interactions and business transactions in their professional life.</p>
<p>
In some of the cases, personal and professional principles and beliefs may collide and cause a moral conflict. For example: A doctor in New Zealand may find the course of medical treatment chosen by patient not right but under the code of ethics for Medical Association the doctors must respect the choice and moreover rights of patient, they must respect.</p>
<h3>
CODE OF CONDUCT</h3>
<p>
Code of conduct is a essential guidelines and reference for engineers or professionals in sustaining day- to-day evaluation making. A well code makes clear all organization‘s operation, ethics and principles, connecting employee with values of professional conduct. The code must be used as a reference for business associated to ethics within the organization in day to day working.</p>
<h3>
MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS</h3>
<p>
An engineer who is a proficient and certified engineer, they need some task to execute, these task can be termed Models of Professional Engineers.
Savior – An engineer saves people or a company from technical danger</p>
<p>
Bureaucratic Servant − An engineer who can be a loyal person. And also a technocrat the one who resolve the technical tribulations a company faces. The organization depends on his decision-making competence for the prospective growth.
Guardian – An engineer is one who knows the direction and right speed which a company should opt, technical guidelines and innovative ideas which must be adopted for sustainable growth are developed by engineer.
Social Servant − An engineer is a person who knows what society needs with the help government, society and organization an engineer is able to laid the foundation of accomplishment of social needs.</p>
<h3>
ENGINEERING PROJECTS VS. STANDARD EXPERIMENTS</h3>

Partial ignorance: The projects are usually accomplished with partial unawareness and uncertainties. Materials purchased are uncertain and not constant. They may vary with the time, requirement and suppliers.
<p>
Uncertainty: The ultimate outcomes of projects are uncertain, eg. during experiments involuntary results, side effects and unexpected risk may occur example leakage of nuclear radiation from an atomic power plant or presence of harmful chemicals in food products, beauty products or soft drinks.
Continuous monitoring: Monitoring the progress and gaining new knowledge is a continuous process. It starts along the planning of project till the execution of project in case of experiment. Even the performance is monitored during the process

Learning from the past: Engineers working are more based on learning from their past (experiment) from their design and problem faced during the course of experiment. From scrutiny of procedure and results, and sometimes from the reports of other experiment. In the absence of awareness, ego, communication or negligence may cause failure or sometimes disaster.</p>
<h3>
ENGINEERING ETHICS - KOHLBERG‘S THEORY</h3>
<p>
Lawrence Kohlberg was a professor at Harvard University during the early 1970s and was famed for his works on developmental psychology. He carried out many studies at Harvard‘s Center for Moral growth and projected a theory on moral development which is usually known as Kohlberg‘s theory. His theory of moral development was reliant on the thinking of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and the American philosopher John Dewey. He was also motivated by James Mark Baldwin. These men had given emphasis to that human development psychologically and philosophically.</p>
<h3>
Lawrence Kohlberg‘s Theory</h3>
<p>
Kohlberg anticipated that people progress in moral reasoning based on their ethical behavior. He postulated that younger children make decision based on the consequences that might occur while the older children make decision based on their perception.

Lawrence Kohlberg‘s assumed that there are six stages of moral development which are further divided into three levels.

Pre-conventional Level

Here the thinker at this stage tends to think and behave based on the straight consequences that might occur. There are two sub-stages in this.</p>
<h3>
Avoid Punishments</h3>
<p>
At this stage usually thinks and consider that the decision are to be made as per the socially suitable norms as they are said so by some higher official (a teacher or a parent). A child behaves obediently to avoid patiently.

Self–interest

At this stage, one shows interest in making decisions according to the rewards they get in exchange of it.
<h3>
Conventional Level</h3>

In the second level of moral thinking, which are generally found at the primary and high school level. The thinker at this stage wants to please others. There are two sub-stages in this.

At this stage, this decision taken may or may not support the law. Whatever the consequence is, the thought process is based on how to make an impression others or society or how to please the people around.
</p>
Post-Conventional Level

This is the third level of Moral thinking, which is generally found after the high school level. The thought processing at this stage tends to think and behave based on a sense of justice.<h3>
MORAL AUTOTMY</h3>
<P>
Moral Autonomy is the viewpoint which is self-governing, i.e., acting autonomously without the control or alteration of others. Moral Autonomy is concerned with self-regulating attitude of a person associated to moral/ethical issues. The theory of moral autonomy helps in improving independence.</P>
Moral Autonomy – Skills Needed
<h3>
Skills required for moral autonomy.</h3></h3>
<P>
Capability to relate the troubles with the problems of economics, law and religious principles – professionals must have the capability to examine and investigate a problem and finding the suitable relation with the existing area.
Skill to process, clarify and understand the arguments against the moral issues − If the issue is aligned with some moral or ethical values to be pursued in the society, then lucidity should be maintained about the differences and similarities.
Ability to propose the solutions to moral issues on the base of facts − If the moral issues are not satisfying and requirements to be, then the resolutions are to be suggested according to the moral issues based on the particulars and truths of the issue.
Must have the creative skill to scrutinize the problems from every the perspective − knowing about the facts and illusions of the issue, a clear understanding is attained in viewing the problem in all kinds of viewpoints. This enables one to be able to recommend a proper substitute clarification.
Broadmindedness while giving moral judgment-- The verdict or the decisions taken, a thorough report of the actions done should be given, while the actions ought to be done should be accessible in a better way, to make sure others that the conclusion have been taken without any prejudice or preconceptions towards any party.
Open-mindedness while giving moral judgment − while affirming the judgment or the conclusion taken, a thorough account of the actions done should be given, while the procedures ought to be done should be on hand in a better way, to ensure others that the decisions have been taken without any prejudice towards any party.</P><h3>
Case study I</h3>
<P>
The Chernobyl tragedy was nuclear disaster that occurred at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26, 1986. A nuclear meltdown in one of the reactors causes a fire that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout that eventually stretches all over Europe.</P>
<P>
Chernobyl nuclear reactor plant, built at the banks of Pripyat river of Ukraine, had four reactors, each capable of producing 1,000 MWs of electric power. On the evening of April 25th  1986, a group of engineers planned an electrical engineering testing on the Number 4 Reactor. With their little awareness on Nuclear physics, they contemplated on experimenting how long turbines would spin and supply power to the main circulating pumps subsequent a loss of main electrical power supply.
The reactor unit 4 was to be shut down for routine maintenance on 25 April 1986. But, it was determined to take benefit of this shutdown to determine whether, in the event of a loss of station power, the slowing turbine could provide adequate electrical power to function the main core cooling water circulating pumps, in anticipation of the diesel emergency power supply became functioning. The plan of this test was to decide whether cooling of the core could continue in the event of a loss of power.
Due to the erroneous belief that this test belongs to the non-nuclear part of the power plant, it was carried out without a appropriate and suitable exchange of information between the testing department and the safety division. Hence the test started with inadequate safety guard and the in commission employees were not alert to the nuclear safety assumption of the electrical test and its potential danger.</P>
<h3>
Lethal Effects of the tragedy</h3>
<P>
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant tragedy in Ukraine, is the only accident in the history of commercial nuclear power to cause fatalities from radiation.
There were many fatal effects due to the radiation released. A few of the effects are listed below</P>
<P>
Two workers had died and 28 emergency workers and staff died in 4 months of the accident due to the thermal burns and the radiation effect on their bodies. Whereas 7,000 cases of thyroid cancer were observed.
Downs Syndrome, Chromosomal Aberrations, Mutations, Leukemia, Thyroid Cancer and Congenital Malfunctions, etc were observed among the effected people. A number of plants and animal faced demolition as after-effect.
The land, air and ground water were all infected to a great extent.</P>
