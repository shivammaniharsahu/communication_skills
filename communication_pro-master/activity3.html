		<li>IMAGINATION FIRST FEELING OF LOVE</li><p>
First feeling of love...when i think of you , I have smile on my face, and in my heart as well  thank you from the bottom of my heart, but for you my heart has no bottom. your smile sets my heart
on fire .I love my life because it gave me you..
I remember that day when i saw you for the first time my heart was beating fast. i was really very happy for no reason i don't know what was that ,but whatever it was good . And i think it was love, actually I don‘t know love so i think it was love. It was best feeling ever, forever. And now when you
are with me, i always feel that event that had happened when I saw you for the first time.</p><p>
When I am with you i forget entire world. i feel very safe and responsible. When with you I like feel myself. When anyone else sees you, i feel jealous my heart becomes normal after lots efforts.
You don't know how much effort I put. I don't know how restless my heart gets. i don't know how much I love you . I heard people face pain of separation I don‘t know they can spend their entire life.</p>
<li>IF I WERE A MAGICIAN</li>
<p>
I remember in childhood I was so struck by the magicians that I wanted to be one. I always thought of getting magical power so that I could get my wish list of doing certain things be fulfilled.
Now that I have this opportunity, I will do following things with my powers-
Remove poverty from the world. Every person should get their daily basic needs of food, clothing, home and education.
Remove pain of losing near and dear ones forever. No one should lose their loved ones ever and everyone should live happily.
Change the concept of beauty. This terribly defined beauty about fair color, having defined body types have suffocated so many for so long and made them feel alone. Let them know they are beautiful and unique with all they have. Beauty is not your facial look but it is all about having a warm heart that can lend his / her hand to someone and can wipe other‘s tears and bring a smile.
Give a home to every child. What a beautiful world it will become when all children out there will have a place to call it their home.
Stop people from killing in the names of religion, population control or anything else and just be a slave to their taste buds. Like us all the other organisms however small it be, have equal rights to live on this planet.</p><p>

Ensure that everyone gets to live their life with the person they love and let ―har Kisi ko yaha Milta hai pyaar zindagi me‖. Let everyone‘s eyes have that sparkle of living it fully. Let no one compromise on it for any reason.
Make world noise free. No horns please. Enjoy the music of silence, smile, togetherness, patience and friendliness.
Make globe boundary less. I know it may sound very dreamy but imagine if you had No visas required to go anywhere because there was no safety concern. No boundaries.
Remove the fear of Heaven and hell from people‘s minds. It has shed more blood than anything else in history. No one should be in prison - be it birds or animals or humans. Neither physical prison nor mental.
Real freedom of expression. People talk out openly about their problems without the fear of being judged. Diminish status, class from society and let everyone be equal as humans.</p><p>
<p>
Let humans be humans.</p><p>
<li>
WHAT IS IMAGINATION?</li>
<p>
Imagination is seeing, hearing, and experiencing with what is inside. My imagination was if had some magic and I‘m a fairy. Then i can do all things which i want to do. If I had magic then i could be able to go from one place to another just by doing magic. With the magic if someone is suffering from any diseases then i was able to cure that person by doing magic. If Fairy world was exists then i was lived in that world and enjoyed each and every moments. In the fairy world no tensions and problems was there only happiness was everywhere. There were so many beautiful fairies. I was the queen of that fairy world. Every people of fairy world always ready to help each other.</p>
<li>
THE GLADIATOR</li>
<p>
Imagination is a way to visualize what we think. The images run on our mind when we imagine something. It may be visualization to various queries to the facts that what would happen if some particular task were done in different manner, or what would happen if I were this or that. Imagination has no limits. I am going to describe the scenario what I‘ve imagined. My content of imagination is as follows:-</p><p>
<p>
I wish that I could have gone in the ancient time. I could live that life in the same way as the kings of that time used to do. I want to go back and want to fight the battles play with weapons like sword, spear, bow and arrows. I wish I could participate in the competition that was held at that time to be a king. I want to win the kingdoms. I want to learn those techniques that they had used to fight and the strategies they used in battles their ruling strategy, diplomacy. Actually that not only teaches an efficient way of ruling but it takes more care of the lives of people and for mankind.</p>
<p>
I wish that I could‘ve born at the time when the great Alexander was born. As all we know about the Alexander that he was a great warrior also and was an ambitious person with great desires. Most important thing about him was that he used to believe on his desires even if they were beyond thethinking of the other kings. He had dreamed about winning the whole world. Almost he had won most of the area but he couldn‘t cross the Indus-river and returned back.</p>
<p>
But I wish that if I could have born at that time then, then I would make my strategy to win the world. As If I were the king from the Indus then I could fight with him and since he had won the Europe therefore by defeating him I could rule over the world and thus I could have become ―THE GLADIATOR‖. So this was the roadmap of my Imagination that how the things would take place if the things could be done in the same way as I imagined.
</p><li>
MY IMAGINATION</li>
<p>
One day when i will get placed at Google that will be the best day of my life. Then after some years when i will get enough money, I will start my NGO. Name of my NGO will be "Aashiyaana". My NGO will totally devoted to orphans and whenever i will get time, I will go to NGO to meet children and I will educate them so that they can make their bright future.</p>
<p>
I will provide them the environment where they can grow as well as make their future brighter so that they can shine like a Star. That is my dream... I know... One day my all dreams will come true not immediately but definitely. Because great things take time :)</p>
<li>
MY EUPHORIA</li>
<p>
It was a very fine morning; the sunrays were striking right on my face, giving me soothing warmth on that bright winter morning. It felt as if I was waking up from a profound sleep. When I opened my eyes I found myself lying on the soft grass of a huge mountain in Austria. I stood up and as I saw the scenic beauty of the place, I couldn‘t resist reaching the state of euphoria. I could see beautiful little houses, some cattle and farms from the top of the mountain. By the side of the mountain I could see a river. The sound of the river was very soothing to the ears. The panorama was so beautiful that I feel short if words to express it. I wish I could capture that beauty in my heart forever. I closed my eyes and tried to feel the comfort of the nature. When the soft breeze touched my skin my mind was completely refreshed. It is rightly said that ―One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.‖ I tried to take with  me as much memories of that place as I could.</p>
<p>
After viewing each and every direction from the mountain, I decided to walk down closer to those little houses and farms. As I reached down I started observing those houses and the cattle closely. The cattle were very calm. The calmness of cattle added to the beauty of the whole panorama. It felt as if an artist‘s imagination had come to life. The people were all peacefully engaged in their work.</p>
<p>
When I started noticing the small houses, I realised that they were all arranged in a systematic pattern. I started counting them. They were 49 in number, as I said 49 out loud, I felt someone tapping my shoulder and shouting 49 loudly in my ears, the whole scene vanished and I woke up in the class saying ―present sir‖ as an answer to my roll call.</p>
<li>
IF I WERE A MILLIONAIRE</li>
<p>
If I were a millionaire, I would help the poor, the deprived, the disabled and the old people. I would feed and clothe as many poor people as I could and provide them with places to live. I would open libraries and reading rooms. I would use the money for the people whom I love the most. I always wanted happiness and blessings for me and family. By helping the needy and the poor people, I can get blessings from them. Most of the times, blessings can cure a person, whereas money may not.</p>
<p>
I would provide them education which is irreplaceable. Something which you can only be taught. Not given. It will allow them to build a better future for themselves. I would not give them this as a loan. Instead I would give it to them as a gift. From one person to another to ensure we all have a basic standard of living.</p>
<p>
After all we were not all born wealthy, and if you look back far enough, you will find someone, maybe your grandparents or their parents, who was in need. Who was just waiting for a helping hand. For a small favor.</p>
<p>
Besides all this, I would like to take a world trip just once; this cannot be done without so much of money. I would take my family also for a trip around the world. This would give all of us an idea of what the world is and how we are different from others in this same world.</p>
<p>
I am a simple person. That is what I would like to remain even if I become a millionaire.</p>
<li>
IF THE WHOLE WORLD IS MADE OF CHOCOLATE</li>
<p>
I feel very mouth-watering by only thinking that if this world is made of chocolate. First of all I don‘t need to go to buy a chocolate. Whenever I want to eat some sweet, I just look around and grave a bit of anything.
<p>
Nobody will be hungry ever. Whenever someone feels hungry, he can eat anything like stones or soil or tree etc. All the bad things will be good like cigarette or alcohol.</p>
<p>
But there can be a lots of problem created due to this, like if I am driving a car and I have eaten the gear-stick ,then there can be a severe accident.</p>
<p>
But there is one more problem. If everything becomes chocolate then, there will be only one taste of everything and that‘s why we get bore of eating only chocolate. Our taste-buds become useless, we cannot taste salty, sour, bitter etc.</p>

<li>
THE MOST INSPIRING PERSON IN MY LIFE</li>
<p>
The most inspiring person in my life is my father. Like others, I too read about other famous personalities but I didn‘t find anyone who had inspired me like my father. He was the second sibling in his family and had an elder brother and two younger sisters. Even though born to one of the prestigious family in his place, his parents are financially not sound. He was good in studying and was first in each
class he studied. To uplift the family, his brother decided to work in Nagpur while the entire family responsibilities came to my father thus he had to quit from studies and forced him to start a typewriting institute. Both the brothers worked hard for their family. After seven years, my father then joined for b.sc in zoology. Even now he used to tell me that he secured 50 marks more than the second person one his class when I am wasting my time in TV, computer… he was so sure that he will get admission to M.Sc. in in zoology in the best college. But the postman without knowing the value of the admission letter didn‘t take it seriously and thus hand over it to my father at the last date of admission. That forced him to take admission in M.A. he successfully completed it and went M.Phil. and finally got his Ph.D. in linguistics in 1995. In between he managed to arrange the marriage for both of his sisters. He married my mother in 1995 at the age of 35. Even though having a Ph.D., due to less demand in linguistics, he just got a temporary job in the UNIVERSITY OF KERALA with a low pay scale and even now he continues in that job. Despite of these, he brought me up with all resources and guidance that no one else had guided or motivated like him. He gave complete freedom to select my future provided me with all resources. Thus the feeling when I think about my father‘s life is so inspirational.</p>
