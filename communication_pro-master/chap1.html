	<h2 style="text-align: center; ">ROLE-PLAY AND DIALOGUES</h2>
	<div class="jumbotron">
	
		<li>1.1.	Objectives:</li>
		
			<p>1.	This chapter helps the learners to practice the language regularly with comfortably and make    them habit of communicating in English. </p>
			<p>2.	The learners are familiarized with many words and phrases.</p>
			<p>3.	In the course of practice well-versed with the language and communicate easily.</p>
			<p>4.	Speaking skills are well developed and meet the global job requirement.</p>
		
		<li>1.2	Definition</li>
		<p>Dialogue is written or oral formal-informal exchange between people. The term dialogue is derived from the Greek word διάλογος which means dialogos or conversation; where διά means (dia: through) and λόγος means (logos: speech, reason). The first author to use the term is Plato; in his work art of dialectic is closely associated.  Dialogus is a Latin word. Dialogues typically present vocal language inside a context and are thus usually longer than drills. It can be used to:</p>
		
			<li>1.	demonstrate grammar in context</li>
			<li>2.	facilitate conversation</li>
			<li>3.	Provide recreation such as a skit.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These dialogues are connecting activities that provide impulsive use of learner knowledge.  Dialogues are largely used to provide speaking practice but can also develop listening. You can use dialogues to commence and put into practice a function, structure, or vocabulary, and to display degrees of politeness, values and approach levels of formality. Dialogues are useful for listening to and practicing articulation, modulation, and other phonological features. One may develop longer dialogues to provide a spur to problem solving and conversation about a topic. For example,</p>
		<li>1.3	Standard Printed Dialogues</li>
	
			<li>Printed dialogues usually consist of a number of short interactions between two people, as in this shopping dialogue:</li>
			<li>A: Hello sir/maam. May I help you?</li>
			<li>B: No thanks. I’m just looking.</li>
			<li>A: Well, let me know if you require anything.</li>
			<li>B: Ok, thank you.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>1.4	Development and Adaption of Standard Dialogues</li>
		<p>Standard printed dialogues are found in many books. For example, the terminology used are British and not what is heard in your Indian teaching perspective, the language used does not sound natural or genuine, or the dialogue contains too many complex structures or difficult words. These are example where you will want to adapt or write your own dialogues. Here are several points to keep in mind when adapting or writing dialogues for students to practice.</p>
		
			<li>1.	Use “natural” language as to a large extent.</li>
			<li>2.	Include exclamations and expressions where appropriate.</li>
			<li>3.	Avoid a strict question-answer-question sequence.</li>
			<li>4.	Keep the dialogue short so that students can easily retain information it, but long enough to provide framework. </li>
			<li>5.	Depict situations in the dialogue that are significant and useful to the learner. </li>
			<li>6.	Reflect’ level of sophistication and knowledge in the content.</li>
			<li>7.	Retain truth value in the dialogue. </li>
			<li>8.	Create typesets who are more realistic i.e. they have some qualities and speak about to the learners’ experience in some way.
			Dialogues are useful for learning language. However, their usefulness is restricted because the text is encoded so users don’t create their own reply as they must do in real life. The types of dialogues that follow allow for more input. </li>
		</ol>

		<li>1.5	Open Dialogues</li>
		<p>In open dialogues, the instructor provides dialogue partially. User needs to formulate the other half. This often leads to practice in responding to conversational cues but not to initiating conversation. However, such dialogues have worth in allowing students to produce their own responses. Here are some variations.</p>
		
			<li>1.5.1	Variation 1</li>
			<p>For a controlled open dialogue, user is asked to fill the blanks in the dialogue for each user to fill in, as in this example:</p>
			<ul>Example1 
				<li>A: Do you know if the canteen is open on ____________?</li>
				<li>B: No, ________________.
				 Or Yes, I ___________ think so.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>Example 2
				<li>A: What time is it open?</li>
				<li>B: It is open from _________ to ___________.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>1.5.2	Variation 2</li>
			<p>Another variation for open dialogues is dialogue with alternatives such as this telephonic Conversation dialogue. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>A: Yes A or Hello</li>
				<li>B: B: Hello, Can I speak to________?</li>
				or
				<li>A: This is_____?</li>
				<li>B:Yes</li>
				<li>A: ____ do you want to come over for coffee?</li>
			</ul>

			<li>1.5.3	Cue Card Dialogues</li>
			<p>As an alternative of using a standard printed dialogue or open dialogues, one can give respondent more linguistic participation by using cue cards that give information for performing a sequence of communicative acts intended to fit in with a consequent sequence on a partner’s card. One can make them or adapt them from standard dialogues.</p> 
			<p>Card A<br>
			You have just moved to a new locality. Ask your neighbor where you can find the following places: departmental store, park, hospital, school.</p>
			<p>Card B<br>
			A new neighbor asks where to find following services. Use this information to help: Hospital—2 blocks north; Park—around the corner to the left: vegetables—next to the bank; school—on the corner of Main Street.</p>
		</ol>
		<h3>ROLE PLAY</h3>

		<p>1.6	Definition </p>
		<p>The act of imitating the role of a different person, for example as a training exercise or in language learning is called Role play. Role play is an educational technique in which people spontaneously act-out problems of human relations and analyze the enactment with the help of other role-players and observers.</p>
		<li>1.7	Description of Role Play</li>
 		<p>“Role play is a way of bringing situations from real life into the classroom.”  It may also include dramas, plays, socio dramas, and simulation. In role play, one needs to envision a role, a circumstance, or both and cobble together a conversation. “The context is usually determined, but students develop the dialogue as they proceed”.</p>
		<li>1.8	Benefits of Role Play</li>
			<p>1.	They are fun.</p>
			<p>2.	They help respondent to get ready for real-life communication by replicating reality—in situations, in impulsiveness, and in the various roles individuals must play in their own lives. In this sense, they bridge the gap between the classroom and the world outside the classroom.</p>
			<p>3.	They can be used for evaluation and feedback purposes. They can be used to facilitate to establish the degree of mastery attained.</p>
			<p>4.	They can consolidate learning and allow students the opportunity to discover their own level of mastery over specific language content.</p>
			<p>5.	By simulating reality, they allow to feel that they are really using the language for a communicative purpose. Also develop confidence in their ability to use English.</p>
			<p>6.	Enhances self-esteem and improves ability to work courteously.</p>
			<p>7.	They offer good listening practice.</p>
			<p>8.	They allow to experiment with language which they have learned. Where one structures their own dialogue, they provide a special chance to go additional than what has been educated in class and to draw on the full range of their language competencies.</p>
			<p>9.	They allow respondents to articulate who they are, their sense of humor, and their own individual communication style.</p>
		    <p>10.	This provides a chance for practicing the rules of social performance and the various sociolinguistic elements of communication (as determined by roles, ages, topic, or situation).</p>
			<p>11.	They engage the learner physically by involving them completely in language retention.</p>
			<p>12.	They provide a backdrop for understanding attitudes, potential, and behaviors related to the target culture.</p>
			<p>13.	They may be used as a motivation to chat in form of discussion or problem solving.</p>
			<p>14.	They can be extensions of more controlled practice using dialogues. After practicing a dialogue, for example, you might develop role plays based on a parallel situation. </p>


			<li>1.9	Developing Role Plays</li>
			<p>In order to build up a role play, you must foremost have obvious objectives on which to base your role play. The main basis for role plays is functions and grammar.</p>
			<li>1.10	Functions as a Basis for Role Plays</li>
			<p>As with dialogues, the situation used for role play must be within the area of familiarity, probable understanding or acquaintance of the respondent. The more familiar a situation is, the easier it will be for participants fully. Examples include, interacting at college, shopping, talking on the telephone, making appointments, and attending business conferences. Other probable circumstances for role play comprise fancy situations from stories, movies, or simulations and situations in which participants can get ready for a future event, for example, interviewing for a job.</p>
			<li>1.11	Importance </li>
 				<p>Activities that build up and build on children’s self-assurance are important in serving children learn who they are. Role play, including acting out scenarios to trouble solve, story making through dramatic play and carry out in managing with real life circumstances will hold up children’s social-emotional growth and development. Role play will give children the ability to handle difficult and tricky social communications, such as bullying, which may happen as they progress through life. When children engage themselves in role playing it helps to construct their way of thoughts and their thought processing, helps them to build up feelings of empathy. When children are given the opportunity to role play skits/scenarios they will be able to experience the role of bully, victim, and bystander. They will also be taught how to help out others who are being harassed and how to keep away from bullying.</p>
				<p>It is a way to introduce the concept of role play using topics such as of harassment or bullying for this we can develop various scenarios to follow. We can select situations from personal observance or occurring. One can write the scenarios or even use the social scripts available such as Bullying Workshop for children to develop a comfort level and they can write their own. Have the children develop scenarios from their own experiences. The children can write a skit or scenario about a distressing situation having to do with bullying whether the focus is on the bullies, victims or bystanders. Every one of the skits/scenarios should be recorded and presented in a way where the individuals who wrote them are anonymous. For example, have the children jot the ideas down on a piece of paper, hand them in, rearrange them and hand them out again. When ideas are shared among the children, they will also learn about others experiences. </p>
			<li>1.12	Grammar as a Basis for Role Plays</li>
 				<p>Role plays are kind of practicing structures because role plays are lesser controlled than dialogues and drills; it becomes important to choose circumstances and contexts in which the target structure occurs naturally. Remember that because role plays are less controlled practice activities, students may not use the target structures as much as you would like. There are usually several ways to successfully communicate meaning, so consider role play as an opportunity for students to practice a range of speaking and listening skills, rather than a single structure.</p>
			<li>1.13	Situations and motivations</li> 
				<p>Here are other sources for practicing grammar or functions.</p>
				<p>1.	Courtroom situations such as, prosecution of a pickpocket, robber, cybercrime, may be racial intolerance or giving participants a controversial topic for discussion such as “smoking by laws”.</p>
				<p>2.	Everyday situations such as greetings, small talk, and shopping, dining, and family all lend themselves to role plays. </p>
				<p>3.	Written texts, including stories and fairy tales for children and various genres of literature for adolescents and adults. </p>
				<p>In each of these situations, you can develop the role play or you can do so with participants. </p>
				<li>1.14	Role Play for Beginners</li>
					<p>You can carry out role plays with all age groups and proficiency levels. While younger learners and beginners may need support, especially in early stages of participating in role plays, they will still benefit and become more independent and confident with practice.</p>

				<li>1.15	Types of Roles</li>
					<p>Role plays can array from highly controlled, short exchanges, as in a hotel, those that are longer and more open ended. If you want a extremely planned role play, you can write it up in circumstances cards similar to the cue cards as explained earlier. Here is an example of a situation card.
					Instructions: You are making an appointment with your doctor. You have to do this through the receptionist.
					<p>1. Greet the receptionist.</p>
					<p>2. Explain that you want to have an appointment with doctor.</p>
					<p>3. State which and why you want to have appointment with doctor (Particular Doctor).</p>
					<p>4. List your accessible times.</p>
					<p>5. Ask the receptionist when the Doctor is available.</p>
					<p>6. Ask if the receptionist needs any more information is required.</p>
					<p>8. Be grateful the receptionist for her time.</p>
				<li>1.16	How to Prepare participants for Role Plays</li>
					<p>Here are the steps in preparing students for their participation in role plays.</p>
					<p>1.16.1	Identify Aims and Objectives for a Role Play</p>
					<p>The objectives and aim for role-plays should be based on participant’s objectives, course curriculum and needs. Contestants must understand why they are intriguing in the role play and how it will enhance to their learning process.</p>
					<p>1.16.2	Identify the Context for a Role Play</p>
					<p>Be sure to familiarize students with the environment in which the role play occurs. </p>
					<p>1.16.3	Language Presentation for a Role Play</p>
					<p>You will need to prepare students for the language they will use in the role play. Depending on proficiency levels, this may also include nonverbal and sociolinguistic aspects such as register.</p>
				<li>1.17	Steps of Role-playing</li>

					<p>1.	Selection of a problem</p>
					<p>2.	 Construction of role-play situation</p>
					<p>3.	 Casting the players</p>
					<p>4.	 Briefing</p>

				<li>1.19	Advantages</li>

					<p>1.	Allow participants to develop an understanding of others perspectives. </p>
					<p>2.	Support participants to work with others in analyzing situations and developing solutions. </p>
					<p>3.	Provide opportunity to apply concepts they have erudite.</p>
					<p>4.	Gives participants to effectively contrast analytical methods by role playing a fore situation several times. </p>
					<p>5.	Participants offer a channel through which feelings can be articulated and feedback processed.</p>

<li>1.20	Disadvantages</li>

<p>1.	It requires expert’s guidance and leadership.</p>
<p>2.	Sometimes participants may feel threatened.</p>
<p>3.	Used as an educational technique, not a therapeutic one.</p>
<p>4.	Strongly dependent on student’s imagination.</p>
<p>5.	Time consuming in developing group readiness. It should not be used when there is pressure of time present.</p>
<p>6.	 Limited by the teacher’s ingenuity and realistic use.</p>

<li>1.21	Uses and Benefits</li>
<p>Role-playing takes place between two or more people, who act out roles to discover a particular scenario. It's most helpful to facilitate you or your team prepare for unknown or difficult circumstances. For example, you can use it to practice sales meetings, interviews, presentations, or emotionally difficult conversations, such as when you're resolving disagreement. By acting situations like these out, you can search how other groups are likely to respond to different approaches; and you can get a feel for come up to that are likely to work, and for those that might be counter-productive. You can also get a logic or idea of what other people are likely to be thinking and feeling in the situation. Also, by organizing a situation for using role-play, you can build up some sort of experience or self-confidence for handling the situation in real life, and you can build up speedy and instinctively accurate reactions to situations. This means that you'll react efficiently as situations evolve, rather than making errors or becoming overwhelmed by events. It can be also used to spark inspirational sessions, to get better communication among team members, and to see problems or situations from different perspectives.</p>
<li>1.22	How to Use Role Play</li>
<p>It is easy to set up and run a role-playing session. It will help to follow the five steps below.</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify the Situation</p>
<p>To start the procedure, gather participants together, introduce the situation or problem with participants, and support an open conversation to uncover all of the pertinent issues related to problem. This will facilitate participants to start thinking about the situation ahead of the role-play begins.</p>
<p>If you're in a group and people are unfamiliar with each other, consider doing some icebreaker   exercises beforehand.</p>
<p>Step 2: Add Details</p>
<p>In second step set up a scenario with enough details to carry out the task. Make sure all the participants are clear about the problem that you're trying to sort out. Be clear about all the things that you know and what you want to achieve by the end of the session.</p>
<p>Step 3: Assign Roles</p>
<p>Once everything is set, recognize the various characters which are involved in the scenario. Some of these may be participants who have to deal with the condition when it actually happens for instance we can take an example of salespeople. Others participants can be in supportive or hostile roles, and some can play major roles like, an angry client. Once the roles are identified allocate participants with responsibilities and other exercise; they must use their thoughts to put themselves into the minds of the people they're representing. This includes trying to recognize their characters perspectives, feelings goals, and motivations when they transform into character. </p>
<p>Step 4: Act Out the Scenario</p>
<p>Each participant can then presume their character, task and act according to the situation; they can even try different methods and approaches wherever necessary. For instance, if aim of your role-play is to perform a sales meeting, the participant who is playing the role of the prospective client who behaves like an ideal client, and, later he becomes extremely hostile and difficult to handle. You could then test and practice different approaches for handling situations, so that you can give participants experience in handling them.</p>

<p>Step 5: Discuss What You Have Learned</p>
<p>When you finish the role-play, discuss what you've learned, so that you or the people involved can learn from the experience.</p>
<p>Further Tips</p>
 <p>People feel endangered or panicky when asked to role-play, because it engrosses acting. This can make them sense silly, or that they've been put on the spot. To make role-playing less intimidating, start with a demonstration. Handover prepared script to performers, give them some times to prepare, and make them relax at the same time boost their confidence. This approach will prove fruit full and more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Another technique for helping people feel more comfortable is to allow them to coach you during the demonstration. For instance, if you're playing the role of a customer service representative who's dealing with an angry customer, people could suggest what you should do to make things right.<p>
<p>Role-Play Example<p>
<p>In an attempt to improved customer support, Vaidehi, Customer Service Manager for Sipto-Cropto Technologies, sets up a team role-playing session. Acting as the leader/trainer, Vaidehi brings collectively a group of software developers and client support representatives.</p>
<p>She divides the 10 people into two groups: Group I represent the customer support representatives; whereas Group II represents the client.</p>
<p>Vaidehi tells Group I that the clients in this situation is one of Sipto-Cropto's longest-standing clientele. This client accounts for nearly 25 percent of the company's overall yearly revenue. In short, the business cannot lose them.</p>
<p>Vaidehi tells Group II that the client has just received a software product that did not live up to their prospects. While the client has a very old rapport with Sipto-Cropto, this time she's growing somnolent because Sipto-Cropto has formerly sold her defective software on two separate events. Clearly, her relationship with Sipto-Cropto is in trouble.</p>
<p>Vaidehi now allows the groups to come up with their views on both the side for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Next – with this meticulous approach to role-play each group sends forth an "actor" to take part in the role-play. Here the actor gets support and instructions from other members of the team throughout the process of Role-play. Each team is capable to take time-outs and reform quickly as needed. Vaidehi runs from beginning to end the situation several times, starting with the "client" behaving softly and ending with the client behaving aggressively. Each time, a most excellent solution is found. Of course, Vaidehi can at all times ask for additional role-playing and proposals if he feels that the process needs to continue, or that the group has yet to discover the very best solutions.</p>
<p>Once it's apparent that they cannot make out any more solutions to these situations, Vaidehi brings the groups together and talk about the session. During this, they discuss the strategies and the solutions that the actors implemented, and how they could apply them to a real-life situation. Vaidehi also asks each group to write a short summing up of what they have learned from this exercise. He then unites the summaries and provides a print of everything learned to all contestants.</p>
1.23	Key Points
<p>Role-playing takes place when two or more people act out role in a particular scenario. It's most helpful to prepare for unfamiliar or difficult circumstances. It can be used to spark brainstorm sessions, improved communication among team members, and see problems or trouble situations from different perspectives.</p>
