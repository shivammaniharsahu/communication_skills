Writing Paragraphs:</h3>
<h4>
Social conditions for the growth of science:</h4>
<p>
To create scientific temper, there has to be widely shared commitment to and belief in the value of science, particularly among the political elite. Slogans alone are of no consequence. Centres of excellence which allow for cutting edge of research at the frontiers of science have to be carefully nurtured. Clearly this requires both freedom of scientific and economic resource that will sustain such research. This will happen only in societies which give a priority to science.</p>
<h4>
Time denomination:</h4><p>
The measurement of time has itself undergone a phenomenal transition. The unit of measuring time used to be ‘a day’ when the calendars were introduced.  Further it was divided into hours, minutes and seconds. With better technologies, we were able to measure time millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond, femtosecond, and atto second. Thus we keep slicing time to even smaller units. Now the quanta of time are known as Plank's time, i.e. 10-43secods. So scientifically we slice time as short as we can.</p>
<h4>
Connection between time and mind:
</h4> 
<p>
To relate time with the act of mind is a very complex idea. It is not yet understood fully. Is the process of mind a linear process or is it mysterious matrix integration?  Science is far from understanding secrecy surrounding mind and how it works. Regarding this research has to be done to understand properly.</p>

Introduction:</h3><p>
In the words of Samuel Johnson “A man’s letters are only the mirror of life”.  In fact it is right because when we read a letter, we understand of its writer but also look into his soul.  Correspondence with friends and relatives gives lot of pleasure.  A letter conveys mental image of a friend or a relative to the receiver of the letter. To make friends and keep alive love and affection, letters help us. Through these letters, friends and family members living in distant places are brought together. To continue our relations, to convey our problems, the routine activities of life, these letters help us.
Letter writing is the most effective communication skill. They are powerful weapons in the hands of man. Our first prime minister’s letters to his daughter Indira Gandhi   gained so much fame and a great deal of reputation in the minds of Indians.  We can be successful in reaching our goals through writing letters properly and skilfully. Whether in the social life or in the business or offices success lies in good letters as they convey our view clearly and convincingly.</p><h3>
Important tips for writing letters:</h3>
<p>
Correct spelling should be used.<p>
Use punctuation marks at the right place.
Letters should be like as if you are talking to the persons concerned face to face.
Write letters clearly and correctly in easy understanding way.
The official letters should be written in a formal way.
The business letters should be short, concise and to the point.
Maintain clarity and simplicity.
The beginning of the letter should be in a suitable manner.
The letter should be average in length.
Letters should be interesting and impressive to the readers.</p>
<h3>
Types of Letters:</h3><p>
Letters are divided into mainly two types. They are personal letters and official letters or formal letters. Social letters such as letters to friends, family members and relatives come under personal letters. Business letters and Application letters come under formal letters or official letters.</p>
<h3>Parts of a letter:</h3>
<p>
There are six parts in a letter, they are:<br>
The writer’s address or heading.<br>
 The date.<br>
 The greeting /salutation.<br>

<h3>REPORT WRITING
</h3>
<h4>
Introduction
</h4>
<p>Report writing is a formal style of writing elaborately on a topic. The tone of a report should be formal. The important thing is that the focus should be on the target audience .A report presents information on an event, situation or process. It should be written in clear, simple language and in a direct way so as to understand quickly and easily.  While writing a report three things should be kept in mind. They are what the report is about, it is meant for whom, and it is used for what. Reports are of three kinds. They are news paper reports, scientific experiment process reports and official reports.
News paper reports cover current events and everyday incidents of the country and the world. The subjects include education, entertainment, commerce and industry, politics, sports, science and stories of human interest. The writer of these reports present facts as objectively as possible, without expressing their own reactions to the incidents. News paper reports have four important features. </p>
<p>
In the headings the verb is either in the simple present tense, past participle or to + infinitive.
 Mixture of active passive voice is used for factual descriptions.
It includes the opinions of important persons and experts.
News paper reports use the expressions confirmed/unconfirmed and reliable sources.</p>
<p>
Note: The news paper reports or written for college magazine or a class assignment consists of more than one paragraph. In such reports it begins with an introduction where venue, date and time of the event is given. The next two or three paragraphs are used to describe the event in detail. The last paragraph concludes the report.
</p>

<h4>
Reports of Experiments and Processes:</h4>
<p>
The reports of scientific experiments are focused on the procedure rather than the performer. The verb appears in passive voice in the entire report. Imperative sentences are used to explain the experiments in laboratories and for the demonstration of processes.
