<div class="jumbotron">
<h3>4.1	Objectives</h3>

<h4>1.	To introduce the process of interview.</h4>
<h4>2.	To provide the tips for success in various types of interviews.</h4>
<h4>3.	To introduce various questions commonly asked in interviews with necessary clues.</h4>
<h4>4.	To provide guidelines related to pre interview, during interview and after interview
Preparations</h4>


<h3>4.2	Interview Etiquette</h3>

<p>While attending for an interview, we have to bear in mind some important points to come out in flying colors. The success lies greatly upon the planning, preparation and delivery with good presence of mind. Interview etiquette and good manners are essential. Etiquette is the code for polite behavior in a society.  It is a code   the generally interviewer expects .The etiquette of interviews has many elements but they may have inexpressive of what is done in polite society and not relevant to everyday life. However it is very important to follow the right etiquette in a job interview to impress the interviewers.</p>

<h4>4.2.1	Interview dress </h4>
<p>The way of presentation for an interview is one of the major elements in creating impression. Often it is wise to dress decently and conservatively. Before the interview, try to assess the place and the people and gain a good idea of what is best.  In particular it is wise not to dress provocatively. It has been shown that people who dress in a conservative suit are generally more successful for professional jobs.</p>

<h4>4.2.2	Be punctual</h4>
<p>It is good to plan arrive close to the location of the prospective employer well in time. Even try to find the route beforehand. It is possible to reach the reception point a  few minutes early and be in time for the interview. Any last minute rush will make you agitated and stressed and you may not be able to present   well in the interview.</p>

<h4>4.2.3	Good handshake</h4>
<p>It is customary to shake hands, when we meet people. A handshake says much about the                                                          person. A limp handshake by a clammy hand will not impress. A firm    handshake gives a better impression. It is normal to be nervous before the interview, and this may result in a sweaty hand. </p>
<h4>4.2.4	Non-verbal communications:</h4>
<p>Often we think of verbal communication, convey a lot of information. Non-verbal account creates good impression with anyone at the interview. Eye contact shows that you are interested in what the other person is saying and doing and that you have confidence. Posture is also another indicator. Comfortable Sitting in a chair gives an impression of a casual attitude and it gives a "don't care" impression .It is important to make proper eye contact with both or all interviewers, and to sit straight in a chair. It is not always possible to "fake" the body language, so feel yourself positive and attentive before going in for the interview.  Proper body language indicates the right attitude of the candidate. </p>
<h4>4.2.5	Sell yourself;</h4>

<p>We are sending a resume furnishing with all details means; we are ready to sell our skills in the job market.  The hiring manager assess our skills based on the details mentioned in the resume and the answers for the questions during interview and other criteria set by the board members .</p>
<p>The interviewer expects that you are selling your skills.  It is effectively part of the job interview etiquette to be able to sell yourself in a professional and sensible manner. Use examples and specifics to be truthful about your accomplishments and achievements. Detail the reasoning for decisions you made and the ideas that help you to be successful in a particular area.</p>

<h4>4.2.6	Don't dominate the conversation:</h4>

<p>It is necessary to talk in a positive way about yourself. You have to allow the conversation be in two-way. The interviewer asks questions, so be aware of this so that they can get into the conversation. It is also necessary not to be seen as boastful. </p>

<h4>4.2.7	Be truthful:</h4>

<p>To be truthful is one of the interview etiquette, if an interviewer identifies that you are lying, you will not be given job. Honesty impacts how much you can claim you have done yourself.</p>

<h4>4.2.8	Thank you</h4>

<p>To end on the right note at the end of the interview is a short thank you, will help the interview.  It is also good writing a short note after the interview - possibly that evening - to thank the interviewers.</p>

<h4>Some model interview question and clues:</h4>

<h4>1.	Say something about yourself?</h4>

<p>Give necessary information concisely and that shows exactly how you’re fit for the job. Don’t give your complete history either related to personal or employment. Start with the 2-3 specific experiences. </p>
<h4>2.	How did you come to know about the position?</h4>
<p>If you got information about through a reliable source say it then share why you were so excited about it. If you discovered the company through an event or article, share it with them. Show your passion for and connection to the company.</p>
<h4>3.	Do you know anything about the company?</h4>
<p>Know the company's goals, using a couple of key words and phrases from the website, but then go on to make it personal. Say, “I really believe in this approach because…” and give a personal example or two relevant to the context. </p>
<h4>4.	Why are you desirous for this job?</h4>
<p>You should have a good answer for this question because companies want to take people who are passionate about the job.  First, identify a couple of valid points that make the role a fit for you, and then share why you love the company.</p>
<h4>5.	What is the use in hiring you?</h4>
<p>There's no better option for you to sell your skills to the hiring manager. Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things that you can do the work, you can deliver great results and that you'll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you'd be a better hire than any of the other candidate.</p>
<h4>6.	What are the greatest professional strengths do you have?</h4>
<p>Choose your strengths that are quite suitable to this particular position. Be accurate and relevant.</p>
<h4>7.	Explain about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work and how did you deal with it.</h4>
<p>Every interviewee seem nice and pleasant in a job interview but what will happen if you’re hired and Gladys in compliance starts getting in your face. Again, use the good method being sure to focus on how you handled the situation professionally and productively and ideally close with a happy ending like how you came to a resolution or compromise.</p>
<h4>8.	In coming five years where do you see yourself?</h4>
<p>Be clear about your future goals, but consider this: A hiring manager wants to know a) if you've set realistic expectations for your career, b) if you have ambition and c) if the position aligns with your goals and growth and if the position isn’t necessarily a one-way ticket to your aspirations? It’s   good to say role in helping you make that decision.</p>
<h4>9.	Why are you going to leave your present job?</h4>
<p>Often this question is asked.  Keep things positive—Instead, frame things in a way that shows that you're eager to take on new opportunities and that the role you’re interviewing for is a better than your present position.</p> 
<h4>10.	What is your expectation in a new position?</h4>
 <p> I satisfy with what this position has to offer is the good answered.  Be clear in it.</p>
<h4>11.	What type of work environment do you prefer?</h4>
 	<p>Suggestive answer is one that’s similar to the environment of the company you're applying to. </p>
<h4>12.	When did you disagree with a decision that was made at work?</h4>
<p>Everyone disagrees with the boss occasionally, but in asking this interview question, hiring managers want to know that you can do so in a productive, professional way. “You don’t want to tell the story about the time when you disagreed but your boss was being a jerk and you just gave in to keep the peace. Give the answer where your actions made a positive difference on the outcome of the situation, whether it was a work-related outcome or a productive working relationship and a more effective.</p>

<h4>13.	 What is the reason for a gap in your employment?</h4>
<p>If you were unemployed for a period of time, be direct and to the point about what you’ve been up to. Then, start the conversation toward how you are able to do the job satisfactorily with the entire organization and contribute to the growth of organization.</p>
<h4>14.	What are the reasons to change your career paths?</h4>
<p>Why you've made the career decisions describe briefly to the hiring manager with a few examples of how your past experience is transferrable to the new role. This doesn't have to be a direct connection; in fact, it's often more impressive when a candidate can make seemingly irrelevant experience seem very relevant to the role. It also indicates that the candidates interest in different sections in the same domain.</p>
<h4>15.	 When you come across pressure or stressful situations how do you manage or deal with?</h4>
<p>Face a stressful situation head-on in a productive, positive manner and let nothing stop you from reaching your goals.</p>
<h4>16.	 How much salary you are expecting?</h4>
<p>You come up with some expectation and we recommend stating the highest number in that range that applies, based on your experience, education and skills. Then, make sure the hiring manager knows that you're flexible. You know your skills are valuable but you want the job and are willing to negotiation in that way you should convey your idea.</p>
