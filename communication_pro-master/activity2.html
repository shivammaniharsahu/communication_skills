<li>  LIFE</li>
<p>
Life is full of strange experiences – good or bad, happy and sad. One of my experiences is first day of my college which had a great meaning in my life. I remember my first day, had mixed feelings was a little nervous, bit scared from seniors and very excited to meet new people. It's totally a new world to explore, talk to new people, make new friends and give a new start to your life. The first day of college is usually one of the biggest days of a person's life. College means the end of school and the end of all of that drama is what you'd want to think.</p>
<p>
It was a happy day with a happy ending and also a new start towards my life about getting new opportunities in near future. It was an immense pleasure and joy I got that day.</p>
<li>
A MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</li>
<p>
A mountain climbing is a very good activity, in whole life once a time you go to a climbing on mountain. When you go to mountain first time there are follow some rules, precaution and proper guidance because you are inexperienced. So, when you start climbing check your bag is there proper Eating and Dirking material is ready. Before you decide to go on a Mountain climbing, you read a lot about you planned routes. And you also may known about mountain history which distance after checkpoints and peak points.</p>
<p>
When you start climb you feel very happy and excited for, the excitement level of climb is much more, wait a minute and feel that just like you're in Heaven, this is best part of life.</p>
<li>
ROADTRIP</li>
<p>
Roundtrip gives me peace. I love roundtrips. According to me when some problems occurs in life, to refresh our mood just go on road trip. The last road trip of mine was so memorable. I went with my friends to a nearby river to our city .In the middle of our journey drizzle was started. That time the weather was amazing it feels like that the weather also permit us to enjoy their beauty. Then we reached to the bank of river and feel the beauty of river. After these i also saw the rainbow. Then i ate sweet corn. The corn was so tasty. That day I enjoyed the weather and feel the beauty of nature.</p>
<li>
CHOCOLATES</li>
<p>
Chocolates are mood lifter. For me literally chocolates work as an anti-depressant. Whenever I am upset, I eat a lot of chocolates and the feeling after eating chocolates are phenomenal. I feel like I am on cloud 9.Even the aftertaste chocolate leaves in my mouth are  enjoyable. It  is  perhaps one of the only foods that I don't want to wash away. Chocolates give us a very pleasant taste and that taste makes us forget our stress. It makes us calm. I always keep chocolates with me. Dark chocolates can help to lower bad cholesterol, and it can work as an antioxidant. But most importantly chocolate makes

us happy-literally. In small doses, chocolate can have a calming effect on us. All those warm feelings we experience when we bite into a piece of chocolate are not in our head.</p>
<li>
SONG/MUSIC</li>
<p>
Songs in our life is also more important on every occasion in our culture according to our mood. It is also used in psychological treatment. Generally song has been listen while happy hour to enjoy the life without any tension on that time. Sometimes songs also listen at sad moment. I love too much 90‘s song and I can‘t specify to which is my favourite Singer because everyone is best in 90‘s Bollywood industries but in modern day I like to Bollywood singer Arijeet Singh. I also love and listen song/music of every type either which is understandable or not because of music like Punjabi song.</p>
<p>
This is my too favourite because I try to become always happy and smile and I also do it and try to become others happy.
</p>
<li>
SKIT</li>
<p>
Everyone has different source which encourages him. Listening music is my source from where I get strength. Music is very powerful tool. It makes us relaxed. It is a normal phenomenon that we face hard circumstances in our life. At that time we are required something which can give us strength to fight and tackle the hurdles. The most powerful tool for me is listening music. Because it gives me strength to face the situation and to feel it in a positive way.
</p>
<p>
There are many inspirational songs that make me more alive. By listening music I feel that yes, come what may I won‘t let the situation go easily. I‘ll take on this challenge. Whatever be the situation say if I‘m tired then music give a deep relaxation to mind, if I am in some trouble then music reduces my stress. When I feel low or say I‘m in grief then it maintains my patience and make me believe that just wait for some time and all will be ok.
</p>
<p>
So, At slast I would like to conclude the gist of the entire content.
My concrete is listening music. While the abstract is the power, feelings, relaxation, energy and enhanced speed of working that I procure from it, which makes my life easier and gives strength to deal with the situation effectively.
</p>
<li>
CONCRETE
<p>
When  I  was  in  class  5th    and  take  part  in  sports  competition  (race),    I  am    so  excited  and practicing a lot but on that day of competition i have started my race with my competitors with full of energy and confidence, and when i was reached some distance someone behind me push me from  back and then i was fall down but still i get up and start running and i finally reach the final destination and won first prize that is gold medal.</p>
<p>

Moral: If you have passion to do something than never lose hope nobody breaks you!!
<li>
Abstract and concrete:</li>
</p>
<p>
It was a day of September 05, 2005 it was a normal morning like everyday but my dad‘s surprise made it so special to remember it was all not planned ever it could happen I didn‘t even know the surprise only my dad said get ready we are going for longest waterfall jag falls which was 200 kms away from the place named Shimoga where I lived in my childhood days .he took me my sister and mother by car till that I only heard about it .it is so beautiful. on the way I was imagining about that how good place it is and I was so eager to see that place it is also having a five falls namely raja rani rocket and rores and fifth queen and electricity was generated by the turbine rotating and water falling from a greater height to produce electricity .on the whole way I imagined and finally reached within 3hrs. Then what I have seen in photos and heard about it .then all we stepped down to the falls where we enjoyed a lot .Here abstract is how I thinking on the way to the falls and how at last I reached there and remembering it. And concrete is how I felt when I was I front of jog falls.
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed a lot and remembered till now how adventures it was during steeping down to the falls and having a look from down to the falls. So happy to see and hoping could have it back.
</p>
<li>
SKIT</li>
<p>
A leaf once had a desire to fly, so it flew away from the tree that nourished it for a long time.  The tree was confined and had its limitations, so it couldn‘t stop leaf. After flying at a great distance, the leaf dried and died. This emerged the feeling of separation in my heart. The tree like a mother nourished the tree like its child, but the leaf was not confined and ran behind its desires. The flying of leaf symbolises how a child runs behind its desires. The child then realised, how much the love and care of its mother mattered. The drying of the leaf symbolises the pain of separation and how much a child needs its mother.
</p>
<li>
SKIT</li>
<p>
After long time when I went to my home and I saw my parents at that time tears came in my  eyes and I hugged them feeling too much happy and peaceful with them, to see my brother and sister, playing and fighting with them at that time i am too much happy and they also like to live with me. Too many friends came at my home to meet me and we all danced together and talked with each other, suddenly my phone rang and one of my good friend said that he was coming and he was on the way but suddenly he got an accident. Then we all went to hospital to saw him with the sad feeling. And I thought that he was only coming to meet me but he got injured.
</p>
<li>
CRICKET</li>
<p>

From all the outdoor game, my favourite is cricket. I ever like to play and watch cricket. Before taking admission in NIT Raipur, never missed to watch any cricket match of India whatever it was Test, One-day or Twenty-Twenty. I look cricket as an exercise also. I have played gali-muhalla cricket. I like to do both ball and bat. Two years ago, if anyone was said to me, let‘s play cricket, I easily said to him
yes. But after taking admission in NIT Raipur I miss that gali-muhalla cricket. To play or watch cricket, I get much-more happiness. Today whenever I have some time, I like to play cricket. One disadvantage  of this game is that requirement of more than one player. Today it is Very popular in all over world but its popularity in India is on different level.</p>

A WALK TO REMEMBER</li>
<p>
Walking down the streets of Munnar at 5 in the morning is one of the most satisfying things one can do. It was drizzling making the weather quite pleasant. The lush green mountains, clean roads that slightly chilled atmosphere made it much more satisfying. The scenic beauty of the place added to its serenity.
</p>
<p>
Having walked for a while, we reached a waterfall. The chirping of regional birds, the sound of water falling on the rocks combined with the soothing sweet smell of soil refreshed the mood. Those moments were just memorable and dipping feet in the cold water was too serene. All the worries vanished and tension found no room in my head. All I could feel was calmness and peace of mind. Having morning tea in a stall by the waterfall with mountains on a side was relishing. Satisfaction is not found in the concrete jungles but in the lap of nature. To sum up, it was a treat to the soul.</p>
<li>
FOOD</li>
<p>

When I see food, I feel hungry. When I crave for some sweet or spicy food my friends always fulfil my desire. The moment I see the hostel mess food, I feel like I am a patient. When me and my friend feel craving for some tasty dishes, we watch YouTube videos to trick our mind. We are always longings for sunday special. When I think food, cheesy food comes first in my mind. We cook dishes anytime we feel hungry even at 1am or 3am.
</p>
<p>
I love to eat street food specially pani puri and chole bhature. As the saying goes ― Hum to Jine ke liye khaate hain par hum to khane ke lie jeete hain‖. My friend is vegetarian and I am a non- vegetarian, but apart from this we both are happy to share and eat together.</p>
<li>
STREET FOOD</li>
<p>
Street food looks attractive and yummy. In our generation everybody loves street food even if it is unhealthy. I eat street food in every two days, when I see street food I feel hungry and without thinking about money I go to buy food but sometimes I regret if the food is tasteless. I like to eat Chinese food, kulfi and panipuri. We can get street food an affordable price at anytime and anywhere. For a student if he/she craves for tasty food, at low price they can prefer street food as students don‘t get tasty food in their hostel. Nowadays, most of the children eat street food rather than home cooked food. When we travel, street food is the good option according to our budget. Sometimes street food is much better and tastier than restaurant food. Now a days we are too busy with work, so buying street food saves our time than cooking at home. Anyone can just walk a few meters across the street and food is available. Some people argue that street food is not healthy but not all of the street food is unhealthy as
many of the street vendor use mineral water, gloves and hair mask to provide us hygienic food. Whether other people say it is healthy or unhealthy but I love to eat street food.</p>
<li>
BIKE</li>
<p>
Here is always a materialistic thing, a sport, a place, a living thing or anything that makes the person feel alive. Mine is a materialistic thing with two wheels that gives me the feeling of happiness. Yes that a bike. The kind of feeling which a bike could give to a person i don't think anything else could give him. When i am free i feel like going out on long tours with my bike. When you are in the city waiting for the red light to go green and as soon as the light turns green and you give some throttle, the bike's engine roars like a lion, and starts running like a cheeta leaving all the traffic behind. And while you are cruising for some long tour and you are slowly heading toward your destination you feel like you are the god with no boundaries. While I am on the bike the breeze touches the whole body making me relaxed of the whole days stress. The feeling which the bike can give cannot be gained on car or train because while you are riding you can feel lots of thing by your side and you can see feel the sky above you, you can see the ground moving under your feet which is not possible in a car. But yes while riding you have to bit careful, you need to wear all the gears and helmet is a must.</p>
<li>
FRIENDSHIP IN DISGUISE</li>
<p>
I share everything with him. There was a time when I would cry if someone would steal my pencil or eraser in the school. I would come running and would wrap myself around him and feel the safest. The time changes but my friend and I still share everything that happens with us. My daddy unlike most other daddies is one of my best friends, the one who has witnessed me growing up from a tiny tot to what I am today. I never feel hesitated talking to him; we would talk hours about our days. He would complain about his hectic schedule at office and I would start telling stories about how teachers used to scare me in my school. Sometimes, my mumma feels jealous seeing us, giggling and laughing together. He is the one who has defined friendship to me in the best way possible.</p>
<p>
He understands me well like no one else does and I feel great to have him as my best friend.</p>
