<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
Communication is also being acquainted with the responsibility for the message you convey to each others. Communication can be with a friend, colleague, fellow citizen or student. Foremost requirement for communication is it must base on certainty and ethics. There must be no space for ambiguousness. Communication fortifies the medium or language delivering message. Use of medium that limits the audience or message must be avoided. For example, if you are addressing to an addressees who are mainly deaf or hearing-impaired, ethic call that communication must be based on sign-language or interpreter.
Absence of ethics in communication can jeopardize ones specialized and individual integrity and trust. For example, president of company must assure that his staffs is his extended family and all of a sudden news breaks that a large corporation has bought their family business. This act will lose the trust of employees, and they will doubt the company in future.
Illusion of Communication</p>
<p>
―The single greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.‖  —  George Bernard Shaw
Communication is defined basically as be active of imparting or allocation of information between parties. When someone says something to one another, communication did take place. Communication carries an indirect anticipation of understanding. Usually, they wait for an action as a result. We address many things in day today life one shares his or her experiences and brilliance they correspond with assurance but what regarding the addressees and their ability to converse are they capable to comprehend at that level.
To understand this we require three elements of communication:</p>
<p>
accurate definition
Indirect expectation
Common experience</p>
<h3>
FAILING TO CONFIRM THE MESSAGE</h3>
<p>
It‘s very general for listeners that they make believe they understood by nodding their head or waving of hand regardless of failed communication and message is undelivered. There is always a conflict between the false impression and the experience, as everybody converse and everybody is an addressee they recognize and confronts of communication and struggle to overcome the on-going challenge of communication as an obstacle to communication success..</p>

TECHNIQUE TO AVOID COMMUNICATION FAILURE
<P>
Challenge of any communicator is to wrap up all the ideas into explanations for the people. To overcome this we must</P>

<h3>
Build framework</h3>
<p>
Come to an early conformity about a dilemma or predicaments that exists. While communicating, communicator must indulge in conversations and come to the point where addressee is able to connect with communicator and this is the right time to introduce your idea. Once the rapport is created between them it easy to communicate and chances of failure also decreases.
Build Rapport

To connect with someone one must be accustomed with his or her fears, dilemmas, intellectuality level and their journey. This will facilitate communicator to know about the audience and helps to build rapport. One must stay away from details and technical terminology and focus on the problem that is solved.</p>

<h3>
Use correspondence</h3>
<p>
Connections formed with audience must be utilized during communication. Example if communicator is selling sprain relief cream or message oil, he must ask about whether they are happy with it or they want another option. Connect the audience with the product to something they previously know.
</p>

WHY TO OVERCOME THE FAILURE DURING EXPLAINATION
<p>
One must consider about explanation is, it is a tool, which can be applied to solve a dilemma. When understanding is necessary, one must take the time to write down your details so you can consider through the flow and how you package ideas. Little planning can help you go a long way. By captivating  a step backside, writing out the ideas and thinking about explanation as a instrument, you‘ll discover ways to get better.

FORGETTING CALL OF ACTION</p>
<p>
During communication due to confusion communication get affected and more we get affected the more disconnected we become from each other and potential efforts to persuade behaviour change are refuse to go along with. More or less it desensitizes all the approaches of communication or else it takes longer span of time and more effort and most of the times results in discontentment. At every level the consequences of crash of communication can be catastrophic. Take the instance of Nokia, was lashed</p>
<p>
out hard, to make a comeback. The cause was senior executives unsuccessful to meet tasks and other responsibilities such as communicating proper values and their approaches towards solving problems faced during communication. We must understand that Communication is a tactical topic, it must be dealt with immense care and nurture it with effectiveness. Vision and mission both are very important aspects of communication and at the same time very compelling during communication is also very important. Failures of communication wear down and annihilate faith.</p>
Failure of call of action reduces when:
<p>
I know what is expected from me at work.

At job, my view seems to count.

There is a big shot at job that support and push me for development.

The job or principle of my business makes me feel job satisfactory.

I have acknowledged appreciation along with identification for my work.

My boss seems to be concerned about me.</p>

<p>
Chances when there is more chance of failure of call of action

When employees are not aligned with mission and vision

When employees are indistinct on goals, happenings and timelines

Employees don‘t always recognize who are their prospective customers.

Employees are disorderly about when to correspond with others

Employees don‘t know how to commune properly with managers, staff, and others.</p>

<p>
Calls to action use action verbs in the imperative form -- such as "Click here,"
"Sign up," "Call now," "Subscribe" "Download"
"Limited time offer"
"Act now."
These typically use words to promote the addressees to act speedily. Calls to action should have convincing and more over persuasive copy and eye-catching design and be relatively simple.</p>

<h3>
IGNORING BEAUTY OF ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>
A terror of argument is a root cause of distress for many people. Workplace problems, relationship predicament, and interpersonal troubles could probably be resolved or reduced only if people were capable enough to address their anxiety in an open and direct manner. One who stays away from war of words often make justification for their behavior, such as ―I‘m a calmer‖ Whether it‘s an irritating and bothersome co-worker who leaves tea cups all over the office or mother-in-law who cracks inappropriate jokes or a serviceman at lift or shopping mall who overhears your instructions. As a result, the trouble never gets resolved and leaves the individual distressed to suffer.
To argument with someone you don‘t need to be assertive but confronting someone in an assertive manner doesn‘t need to be terrifying. Sometimes you also find that others welcome your suggestions or arguments and put on positive change for their own benefit. If you‘re doubtful of communicating your own view in a direct approach, here are six ways to get over your fear of argument:

IDENTIFY THE TROUBLES.</p>
<p>
You won‘t modify your performance or behavior unless you are going to realize or made to realize that your current actions aren‘t working. For this you can note down the troubles you experience when you avoid argument. Possibly you go home from job feeling harassed. Or maybe your association with an important person close to you becomes more spoiled every time you let that person to hurt your feelings.

POINT OUT WHAT YOU MAY GAIN BY SPEAKING UP.</p>
<p>
On the back of the similar piece of paper, note down what you could accomplish by vocalizing.

Your associations with people troubling you might improve.

Your troubles might get solved

You might turn out to be happier.</p>

Be specific about the things you stand to gain.
<p>

Every time you stay quiet and ignore argument, go through both lists. Identify the logical and rational explanation that why you should argue with someone and how things will change, this will boost your guts and confidence and also help you out to do it.</p>

REASSESS YOUR OWN ASSUMPTION REGARDING ARGUEMENT
<p>
Fear of argument based on assumptions which are often false. Thoughts like ―Argument is bad,‖ or,
―Telling someone I disagree with them will ruin our relationship‖ only increase your fear regarding arguments. In reality, altercation or arguments are healthy. When one speak up and express his or her opinion, this might better the situation more than one ever even imagine.</p>

ONE ISSUE AT A TIME MUST BE ADRESSED.
<p>
Suppose there‘s just someone you tend to avoid argument like a predominantly challenging co-worker then one must choose one small issue to address. Don‘t pick the bigger problem and start small issues and see what happens. If you keep away from speaking up to when everyone is around you, avoid in public or one can choose a safe person to confront first. This will increase your confidence level regarding arguments.

KEEP WORKING ON SMALL STEP AT A TIME.</p>
<p>
―Confronting someone is more of an art than a science‖. What mechanism well in one situation might not work in another, But with practice, one will be able to identify when to speak up, how to do it, and the best ways to express yourself effectively. Consider efforts a work in progress and take small steps. Confrontation gets easier with practice. The more you address up for yourself, the less worrisome it becomes.
SELECTION OF WORDS</p>
<p>
Communication is the spread of meaning or interaction with others. In communication it is important for other persons to understand what we want to communicate and not failing into what is the intended meaning behind the communication. Always Specific and focused communication grantees an intended meaning to addressee. Sender must have a complete knowledge and understanding about the message to be communicated and at the other end the receiver interprets the message. Hence for an effectual communiqué the sender must be able to determine the reason and idea of the communication taking place.

MEANING OF TERMS AND VOCABLARY
The scientific study of meaning is called Semantics.</p>
<h3>
LABELS AND WORDS</h3>
<p>
―Words are labels and Labels are arbitrary‖

General cause of misinterpretation is pretentious that the word (a label) is the object. Two people can then be in conflict about a concept, referring to it by using the same word, arguing because this word means something different to each of them. The foremost requirement to be meaningful is both the sender and receiver of a communication must have the same thought and intellectual level.</p>
<h3>
CHOOSING THE WRONG MÉDIUM</h3>
<p>
Medium of communication is very important aspect that if medium or channel used for communication is not correct or effective even though the idea is viable, the effectiveness of message or idea would not create the same effect and would end up creating misunderstanding or even worse sometimes. Using the erroneous channels slow down or hamper communication, but doing so can cause distrust, particularly about your earnestness and dedication to them.</p><p>
Example: Manager decides that he wants to communicate the letter that he values their work and well- being. He can use number of channels to communicate with employees either he can talk to them face to face, wish them and ask about their well being or send out personal letter or an email every morning and ask their wellbeing.<p></p>
Every time each and every message must be communicated through suitable medium. An inappropriate medium can create an obstacle or obstruction in communication. Examples: communication in big organization especially in big organization where departments are far away from each other. Manager can connect with the head of different department using various means of communications like email or letters to maintain confidentiality in big organization if wrong medium is chosen for communication it will not fulfill the requirement and thus become barrier. An erroneous medium or an unsuitable medium which is chosen for communicating message will act as a obstacle to communication. Balancing one medium of communication with another appropriately can help to triumph over communication barrier caused by the medium chosen. A verbal prompt to someone or over the telephone followed up with a written letter can effortlessly produce the most wanted response or expected reaction.</p>

DANGER OF HALF BAKED IDEA
<p>
If you describe an idea or plan as half-baked, you mean that the idea has not been properly thought out, or it is impractical. Communication starts with germination of ideas in the mind and then it incubates in the mind. The communicator analyses ideas validity and identify the sequencing of ideas. Foremost thing with germination of idea is it must be identified, analyzed, and must be arranged, this process must take place before communication. Testing of ideas would help us in arriving to the solution. The recipient should not feel that sender is mentally toying with his/her half baked idea during the conversation. All this process must be commenced before communication takes place and if Sorting issue, analyzing and arriving to the solution must ideally be completed before the commencement of communication.</p>
THE ART OF EXPLANATION
<p>
Explanation is an art and a fundamental communication skill which is very much necessary for necessary for effective communication. Explanation plays a very vital role in our communications, however we hardly ever take time and sit back and think about it. We must see explanation as something that we must work always on it as the more improved explanation is the more effective it is. After expressing or communicating we can only assume that addresses understood and it is not necessary that our assumption will be accurate, we may also fail.</p>
<h3>
FEAR OF DISAGREEMENT</h3>
<p>
Disagreements are an unavoidable, healthy and normal part as agreement. Conflict-free work environment is myth. When you work or live in an environment people of different background and different intellectual background come together so conflict is an inevitable aspect and also helps in betterment. When you and your colleagues push each other continuously, towards betterment, that creative friction will surely lead to new solutions. It is often seen that conflict always allows team to come to come together in difficult situations, to synthesize diverse outlook, and solutions towards problems unanimously.</p>
<p>
One must readily accept all the disagreements. By listening and integrate feedback, one gain knowledge and understanding try new things, and evolve as a leader. Disagreement must not be taken as obstacle but as an instrument for betterment it helps us to think through everyone‘s perspectives.</p>
