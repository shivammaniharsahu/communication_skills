	<h3>Nature and Importance of Presentations:</h3>

<p>The presentation is made different purposes such as academic purpose business purpose or informative purpose. Both the speaker as well as the listener involve in the process. The topic should be dealt with from the listener‘s perspective. Knowing the audience, the Presentation should be planned. Promote  the interest of the Audience. Keep in mind the needs and expectations of the Audience. Analyze the occasion. Set the material according to the time allotted. Select and narrow the topic according to the occasion and level of the audience. To inform to persuade, to explain analyze the audience, analyze the occasion, choose an appropriate title.</p>
<p>Develop the Central Idea, Develop the main idea, and collect the Supporting Material. Procure and arrange the Visual Aids. Make your Presentation in an organized way with proper introduction, development of thought, Conclusion. Rehearse the Presentation, before a full length mirror assuming the presence of a live audience. Introduce yourself to the group members. The presentation environment should be entertained, handle the stage fright before setting the realistic goals. Have positive thoughts. Speak slowly, confidently. Learn and practice stress reducing techniques. Be organized. Use proper body language. The dress code need to be followed. In the end of the presentation session answer all the questions. Be patient enough. Eye contact is very important in the presentation so keep eye contact with the audience. Speak without breaks or halts. Have a good knowledge on your topic. Smile and look gentle .Close in a striking way. Use a  suitable quotation that  fit to the context.</p>
<h4>Tips for Effective PowerPoint Presentations:</h4>

<p>To create a consistent and simple design template the slide master feature should be used.

<p>The change of content presentation is fine. Maintain other elements such as font, colors, and background. Simplify the language and limit the number of words on each screen.</p>
<p>Use important phrases and include only essential information. For text and background use contrast colours.
On a light background, dark text looks good.</p>

<p>These features may seem impressive at first, but are distracting and get old quickly. Good  quality  images should be used that reinforce and complement your message. Only "build" screen makes your point, because they can slow your presentation.</p>
 
<p>Limit the number of slides. An important rule is that one slide per minute. Learn to direct your presentation in a non-linear fashion. Know how to and practice moving forward and backward within your presentation.</p>
<p>If possible, view your slides on the screen you are using for your presentation, when audiences ask to  see the previous screen again. Make sure they are readable from the back row seats. Text and graphics should be in a considerable size to read, but not so large as to appear "loud." In the event of technical difficulties have a plan?</p>
<p>Remember that transparencies and handouts will not show animation or other special effects. Practice with someone who did not see your presentation. Ask them for fair feedback about colors, content and graphics you‘ve included. The presentation is for the audience, not for the presenter. ―A Theme is a memory aid, it helps you through the presentation as the thread of continuity for your audience." Dave Carey". The pitch of the voices hold be ideal. Your presentation suit is your power point. How the audience felt about you, they will remember. They will forget our name and your message.</p>
<p>In any kind of successful presentation, Planning is the most important step. During planning, decide the content and the order of presentation. Use the following steps as a guide when planning a presentation, whether you are using PowerPoint, Open Office Impress or any other presentation software.</p>
<h4>The Purpose of the Presentation:-</h4>

<h4>Why you are giving the presentation and what you hope to accomplish you should know. It may be a:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Presentation about a product for a client.</li>
	<li>Business presentation about the latest sales figures.</li>
	<li>Introducing a new idea.</li>
	<li>An informational presentation to an association.</li>
	<li>A topic of education.</li>
	<li>Focus your presentation on the interests of your audience.</li>
<h4>A new client prospective</h4>

	<li>A group of small children. A convention for  people  in  the  same  line  of  work.  Collect the most important information.</li>
	<li>Keep it simple, stupid when designing your presentation.</li>
	<li>Focus on three or four main points only.</li>
	<li>Know at full length about your topic so that you can answer all questions after the presentation.</li>

<h4>Keep your interesting Slides on the Topic.</h4>

	<li>Plan the slides to stress upon the main points in the presentation.</li>
	<li>Place only one main idea on each slide.</li>
	<li>Per slide list not more than four points.</li>
 
	<li>Use shifting that enhances your presentation, not that detract from it.</li>

<h4>Preparation of the Presentation</h4>

	<li>If your software supports, use speaker notes to plan which topics you want to be sure and cover each slide displays. Plan time for a run-through before the presentation.</li>
	<li>The most important part of making a successful presentation is planning. This is the  base and you should dedicate as much time to it as possible avoiding short-cuts.</li>
	<li>Good preparation ensure that you have thought carefully about the messages that you want to communicate in you presentation and it will also help boost your confidence.</li>
<h4>The subject of the presentation is not one and the same thing. For example:</h4>
	<li>The subject may be given by an inviting organization.</li>
	<li>You may be knowledgeable in particular field.</li>
	<li>The subject may be your choice under certain conditions.
</li>
	<li>The Audience</li>
	<li>Before preparing material for a presentation, bear in mind your approaching audience.</li>
	<li>Tailoring your talk to the audience is important and the following points should be taken into consideration.</li>
	<li>The size of the group or audience expected.</li>
	<li>The age range - the presentation is meant for retired people will be quite different from the teenagers.</li>
	<li>Gender – is the audience predominantly male or female?</li>
	<li>Will you be speaking in their work or leisure time?</li>
	<li>Do they know something about your subject already or will it be totally new to them? Is the subject part of their work?</li>
	<li>Are you there to inform, teach, stimulate, or provoke?</li>
	<li>Do you use humour and if so what is considered to be appropriate to the context?</li>
	<li>It is important to have advance information about the place where you are going to speak.</li>
	<li>See the venue before the speaking event, as it is benefit to be familiar with the surroundings. It does much to avoid fear if you visualize the place while you are preparing your talk. It would also give you the opportunity to try out your voice. If possible, you need to know, the size of the room.</li>
 
	<li>The seating arrangements can be altered, if necessary. The availability of equipment, e.g., microphone, overhead projector, flip chart, computer equipment.</li>
	<li>The availability of power points and an extension lead is required for any equipment you intend to use.</li>
	<li>Often there will be no flexibility in the time of day that a presentation is made.</li>
	<li>The best time to speak is the morning session, as people are at their most alerts generally.</li>
	<li>Mid afternoon is a good time, whereas at the end of the afternoon people may start to worry about getting home, the traffic or collecting children from school.</li>
	<li>People are more likely to be present outside regular office hours because they want to be rather than have to be there.</li>
<h4>Duration</h4>

	<li>If there are other speakers Know where you are placed in the running order. Never prefer last to speak.</li>
	<li>It is to remember that people feel difficult to concentrate for long periods of time, because of this reason, for making a presentation brief, well-structured and interesting. A maximum single-session presentation should be not more than 40- 50 minutes.</li>
	<li>Organize the Presentation Material: The delivery should be well-structured and clear. It should be planned in such a way. you should know exactly what information you want to give and the order of the matter in which you want to say it.</li>
	<li>Having thought about and planned a good structure will also help to avoid nervousness you are feeling in the build up to your talk or presentation.</li>
	<li>Clarity of mind is the clarity of expression so during the presentation only the topic should move in the mind and no deviation to the mind. The presence of the mind is very important during any purposeful and serious talk or presenting ideas.</li>
<h4>Clarity of ideas and good organization result in a lively, logical and necessary message, delivered in a confident and professional way.</h4>
	<li>The presentation material organization may include</li>
	<li>Extraordinary ideas relevant to the topic.</li>
	<li>Selecting the main points.</li>
	<li>Deciding whether to explain with examples.</li>
	<li>Keeping your objectives in mind, write down all the important points you want to say.</li>
 
<h4>Presentation should be divided into three sections:</h4>

<h4>Introduction (beginning) Main Content (middle) Conclusion (end)</h4>
<h4>A useful structure would be the following:</h4>

<h4>In the introduction tell the audience what your subject is and how you have planned the presentation. State the key points.</h4>

<h4>Next tell them the details of the key points by expanding and qualifying the key points in more detail and providing suitable examples.</h4>

<p>In the concluding session tell the audience the key points and the main subject again. Work on the main content first.
The most important things have to be said. If the material is too much selected the important that is quite relevant to the topic.</p>

<p>Four key points are sufficient for a 15-20 minute presentation. Six key points are sufficient for a 20- 30 minute presentation.</p>
<p>Eight key points are sufficient for a 40-45 minute presentation.</p>

<p>Arrange the key points in a logical order and expand them with supporting material - discussion, argument, analysis and appeal. If you wish to persuade people then it is advisable to address strong objections within the presentation. so that your presentation is reasoned, well-balanced view.</p>
<h4>Personal anecdotes, real-life situations or hypothetical examples to bring them to life benefit most.</h4>

<p>When the presentation is short and informal it is not necessary to use visual aids. When the presentation last long, visuals are used.</p>
<p>To support a presentation, PowerPoint or other presentation software is often used. Although care should be taken to ensure that this technology helps the presentation and does not detract from the main idea of your talk.</p>

<h4>Introduction and Conclusion</h4>

<p>The introduction should give a preview of the presentation and should gain the attention of the listeners with a statement of purpose. Make it clear if they arise questions during the
 
presentation, you wish to accept, thereby breaking your flow and risk being side-tracked, or will invite questions at the end.</p>
<p>The conclusion should summarize the main points and argument but this time try to use different words. End decisively,  your presentation is finished beautifully and satisfactorily, this is also the time to ask the audience whether they have any questions .If the introduction is good, the conclusion should be the best.
<h4>Introduction, body and conclusion:-</h4>

<li>	Presentations should be direct and logical. It is important that you avoid complex structures and explain and discuss your work clearly for which much attention need to be paid. An ideal structure for a presentation includes:</li>
<li>	The introduction part should be a welcoming and informative.</li>
<li>	The body which consists of main points should be presented in a coherent series and in a logical sequence;
<li>	The conclusion should be purposeful and clear.</li>
<li>	These elements are discussed below. </li><h4>The introduction</h4>
<p>The introduction is the first part in which the presenter states the purpose and gives the presentation details. This is a very important part of your talk as it gains the audience‘s interest and confidence. The Key elements of an effective introduction are</p>
<p>A positive start: ―Good morning , my name is Rahul and …‖;</p>

<p>A statement of what is to be discussed: ―My topic for today‘s presentation is…‖</p>

<p>A statement of the treatment to be applied to the topic (e.g. to compare, contrast, evaluate, describe): ―I am going to compare the three main principles of …‖</p>
<p>A statement of the outcomes of the presentation: ―I hope this will provide us with …‖</p>

<p>A statement of what the audience should do (e.g. when they can ask questions or whether they will need to take notes or not): ―I will distribute a handout that summarizes my presentation before taking
questions at the end.‖</p>

<p>Aim to speak your beginning confidently (wait until the audience is quiet before you start speaking) and communicate your topic with energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<h4>Main points</h4>

<p>The main points are the key points of your talk. They play a vital role to prioritize, focus and sequence your information. When planning your presentation, produce a summary of the main points that you would like to make, use a few words and short sentences to express each point. Ask yourself: ―what am I
 
really telling them? What should they be learning here?‖ Your answers to these questions will help youcommunicate clear and effective messages to your audience.</p>
<p>After identifying your main points, you should beautify them with supporting information. For example, add clarity to your argument through the use of diagrams, illustrate a link between theory and practice, or confirm your claims with appropriate data. Use the supporting information to add color and interest to your talk, but avoid detracting from the clarity of your main points by overburdening them with too much detail.</p>
<h4>Transitions:</h4>

<p>Transitions help the audience to guide their way through your presentation. They divide into sub- sections, link different aspects of your talk and show progression through your topic. Importantly, transitions draw the audience‘s attention to the process of the presentation as well as its content. Examples include:</p>
<p>―I am to begin by discussing …‖</p>

<p>―Now that we have explored the ... I would like to move on to …‖</p>

<p>―In contrast to my earlier statements related …‖</p>

<p>―Moving away from a focus on.…‖</p>

<p>Without speaking Transitions can be made. Non-verbal transitions include pausing, changing a slide or other visual aid, moving to a different area of the room before resuming speaking, or making eye contact with a different group in the audience.</p>
<h4>The Conclusion:</h4>

<p>The conclusion is an essential t underdeveloped section of a presentation. This is the stage at which you can summarize the content and purpose of your talk, Give an overview of what has been achieved and make a lasting impression. Important elements of a conclusion are:</p>
<p>A review of the topic and purpose of your presentation: ―In this presentation I wanted to explore</p>

<p>A statement of the conclusion to be drawn from your work: ―I hope to have been able to show that the effect of ‖</p>
<p>An indication of the next stages: ―This does of course highlight the need for further research in the area of …‖</p>
<p>An instruction as to what happens next (questions, discussion or group work?): ―I would now like to give you the opportunity to ask questions …‖</p>
<p>a thank you to the audience for their attention and participation: ―That‘s all I have time for. Thank you very much for listening.‖</p>
 
<p>As with your introduction, you should try to speak to the listeners directly during your conclusion, consolidating the impression of a confident and useful presentation.</p>
<p>A presentation needs a well defined structure to make the most impressive.. This should centre on a series of identifiable main points that are supported by appropriate detail. Use transitions to link and move between points, helping your listeners to understand the development or your argument. An introduction and conclusion are important parts of your presentation. They help you to establish a clear purpose for your talk at the start and summarize your main points before you finish speaking.</p>
<h4>Rehearsal and improving delivery, handling stage fright:-</h4>

<p>Practice only  will make  ―that was the best speech I‘ve ever heard‖ response  from  your audience.  For this, you have to acquire public speaking skills and build up the confidence.
While practice you won‘t necessarily make you perfect, practice your speech you will gain significant benefits at least a couple times:</p>

<p>When writing and editing you may not notice certain unimportant points such as awkward phrases and tongue-twisters which should be discovered and removed. Loud exposes flaws that reading does not.</p>

<p>Asses your energy level: Does delivering this speech interesting? Or are you bored with it?</p>

<p>Estimate your timing. Once you gain experience, you learn how many words can fit in a 10-minutes time. However, practicing the speech and complete it, if you are under or over time. Completion of the speech with expected points is always the best.</p>

<p>Reduce nervousness. Repeated practices will improve your confidence in your material surely it will reduce nervousness.</p>

<h4>How to Rehearse Your Speech</h4>

<p>―Rehearsing even one time will improve your confidence in your material.‖</p>

<p>You might practice for 60 hours. You might practice for 60 minutes. Either way, here are a few tips that will help to have maximum benefit from rehearsing that means it is not time consuming process.</p>
<li>	Re-create the speech setting unless you are preparing for a webcast. Mere reading your speech before podium is not ideal. Try to duplicate the speech setting as much as you can.</li>
<li>	Practice in the room or in a corner or where you feel comfort to practice.</li>
<li>	Stand up. To project realistic voice stand up and speak.</li>
<li>	Practice with props and visual aids.</li>
<li>	Arrange an audience. Practicing with an audience is better than practicing without one… even they are not your target audience.</li>
 
<li>	Think of what you are going to wear, when you are going to deliver your speech. is it going to add complications? Inhibit gestures or movement in any way?</li>

<h4>Take notes</h4>

<p>Don‘t hesitate to stop in the middle of your rehearsal to write down the ideas as they come to you. Understand the internal feelings immediately.</p>

<h4>Experiment:</h4>
<p>Try out different voices, gestures, or staging. This is especially important for your opening, conclusion and any other key points. Give yourself confidence knowing that these lines will be delivered exactly as you intended.</p>

<h4>Adjust Time yourself</h4>

<p>You can easily do this, but it helps if someone else can time you. Insert plan where to insert pauses, and insert delays when you expect laughter or audience response. This may feel funny, but accurate time estimation will give you idea if more editing is needed.</p>

<p>Use, all that you learn to edit your speech and make it better. Taking Feedback:</p>
<p>―After the rehearsal, take feedback. Make it clear that you want honest opinions about what is to be improved to make a good presentation.</p>
<p>o	It is the best practicing your speech with someone who will give you honest feedback.</p>
<p>o	Valuable feedback is given when practicing with an audience.</p>
<p>o	Your humour is drawing smiles and laughs or it is missing completely?</p>
<p>o	Are you keeping the audience‘s attention completely?</p>
<p>o	There are different ways of giving feedback.</p>
<p>o	Are you receiving positive feedback in the form of nodding heads and smiles, or is it a blank stare the most common expression?</p>
<p>o	After the rehearsal, actively collect feedback. Make it clear that you want fair opinions about improvements.   A dozen  ―Good  speech!‖  comments may encourage you, but            it won‘t improve  the  quality  of  your  speech.  To  reap  feedback  that  will  improve your speech, ask open-ended questions like these:</p>
<p>o	What was your preferred element in the speech? Why?</p>
<p>o	What would you like to see improved?</p>
<p>o	How can I improve my speech for next time?</p>
<p>o	This is far better than asking yes/no questions such as ―Did you like it?‖</p>
 
<p>If the presentation is important to you, and you don‘t have a test audience that provides you with valuable feedback, hire a coach! Hire me or one of thousands of speech coaches.</p>

<h4>Audio Recordings</h4>

<p>Audio recordings help you observe many delivery qualities, including speaking pace, pitch, and pauses. Assess which phrases sound ―good‖ and which are awkward to listen to.</p>
<p>Listen for um‘s, ah‘ s, and other filler words. Notice if and when you stumbled.</p>
<p>Set the overall speech as well as individual segments of the speech and arrange time accordingly.</p>

<p>A video recording of speaking is a very powerful tool. All of your habits — both good and bad — are captured. You can also learn:</p>

<li>	Are your gestures working?</li>
<li>	Are your gestures synchronized well with your words?</li>
<li>	Are your gestures different or are they monotonous?</li>
<li>	Are you smiling?</li>
<li>	Are you fidgeting, or displaying any other distracting mannerisms?</li>
<li>	Is your body moving from side to side?</li>

<p>If the recording was made without a full audience, it is difficult to assess eye contact. But you should be able to tell at least if your eyes are up, or down at your toes.</p>

<p>If you are using visual aids, the transitions should be smooth.</p>

<p>If you are using a prop, it should be handled smoothly?</p>

<p>The speech, delivered formally four times at the club, area, division, and district speech contests.</p>

<h4>The Do's and Don'ts of Good Presentations:</h4>

<li>	Do plan your presentation before you start in PowerPoint - outline your story and the key slides, their objectives and key messages you want to cover.</li>
<li>	Do use work that other person have already completed, but be cautious of using other people‘s slides directly without correcting them, are it up to date and is the slide still effective.
Make sure that when you use other people‘s slide/info that you adjust them to the look & feel and tone of voice of your presentation.</li>
<li>	Do send your presentation to interested parties for feedback where appropriate before you present. They may be able to pick up on errors/missing info or add additional
 
info/insight to your presentation. The best presentations are rarely created by one individual. Remember what you are communicating.</li>
<li>	Do use a consistent look and feel throughout the presentation. When working on corporate presentations ensure that you are following the presentation and specified guidelines.</li>
Is your presentation using the corporate stationery/template, and using the correct tone of voice? Large corporations often have Tone of Voice Guidelines, which are either part of the Brand/Presentation Guidelines, or part of a guideline suite.</li>
<li>	Do with relevant graphics and images break up in presentation will be apt and attractive. Everybody is not interested, but many people are more visually stimulated and therefore need to show images or graphical representations to understand as well as just the words on the screen.</li>
<li>	Do use font size of 14 pt or larger – smaller fonts may mean that people will not be able to read it. If it can‘t be read, it shouldn't be on your slide.</li>
<li>	Do use bullets. Do not use paragraphs. People find it very hard to read off of the screen. Paragraphs make people instinctively switch off and disengage with a presentation as they difficult to read.</li>
<li>	Do maintain gap between lines. This helps to  make them easier to read and makes  them look neater on the screen. ―Presentation‖ look is as important as the content when communicating.</li>
<li>	Do use maximum 15 slides for a 30 min presentation.</li>
<li>	Do, the best presentations are often the ones where you have a bit of fun and engage with your audience.</li>
<li>	Do use handouts – especially for detailed information and complicated diagrams. Depending upon the style of your presentation you can choose to give them either before or during or after your presentation.</li>
<li>
You should indicate in the speaker notes that there are handouts if it is a cascade presentation and these should be delivered to the audiences.</li>
<li>	Do   create   detailed   speaker   notes   using    bullet    format    rather    than   paragraph to make them easier.</li>
<li>	You should provide the following on each of your slide.</li>
<li>	Don‘t assume that the level of knowledge of your audience is same around the details as you do. This is very important when creating cascade presentations and it is important that you provide sufficient detail in speaker notes for the lowest level of knowledge.</li>
<h4>Don‘t over script your presentation</h4>

<p>Keep the presentation simple, use bullets in your speaker notes and break it down using the framework above, when it is likely to be used by others</p>
<p>By using bullets you allow a presenter the opportunity to pick out key information easier and therefore present it more naturally</p>
 
<li>	Don‘t create a presentation which doesn‘t allow time for questions or queries, remember communication is two way. if no one chipped in nothing at all, It is not a good presentation.</li>
<li>	Don‘t dump all your ideas onto PowerPoint as a stream of consciousness. Don‘t use more than	12 words per bullet point on your slides and where possible avoid this on your speaker notes – keep it clean and simple.</li>
<li>	On speaker notes when you have more than one sentence or message per bullet break it up with clear line breaks.</li>
<li>	Don‘t overuse sound and animation – animation that is used unnecessary is irritating to the audience and in a cascade presentation can cause confusion and embarrassment for the presenter.</li>
<li>	Don‘t mix up different styles through your presentation. Use only one style that is simple and beautiful.</o>
<li>	Don‘t create your presentation based on what you want to say or what you think your audience wants to know.</li>
<li>	The best presentations are created based on having asked the audience what they want to know about before you create your presentation. It‘s a little bit of extra work, but the benefits are rich.</li>
<li>	Don‘t create long bullets with several sentences; try to keep your bullets to single sentences, two maximum.</li>
<li>	Don‘t use more than six bullets per slide. if you have headers and footers on corporate template, this should be lessened.</li>
<li>	Don‘t put word for word exactly what you are going to say on your slide. This makes people switch off and they may stop to see either the slide or hear what you are saying. This is a common mistake that people make when presenting and is especially true in cascade presentations where the presenter doesn't know the content and doesn't have good speaker notes to refer to.</li>
<li>	Don‘t put in meaningless slides, e.g. additional slide titles, agendas on a short presentations, etc.</li>
<li>	Don‘t make your presentation assume it will never change if you need to present it again. After  every  presentation  you  do,  think  about   the   questions   that   came   up.   With every presentation your delivery should become much slicker and easier if you adopt this process.</li>
<li>	Don‘t use acronyms or technical terms unless you previously prefaced them.</li>
<li>	Don‘t try to cram too much information into one slide.</li></ul>
